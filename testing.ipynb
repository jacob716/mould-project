      "Scope\n",
      "Following instruction from ……………………., attend the above property to undertake a damp related survey\n",
      "to aid reported ongoing issues.\n",
      "Report\n",
      "1.0 Property:\n",
      "The property is a ground floor one-bedroom flat of cavity\n",
      "wall construction and a solid floor.\n",
      "2.0 Incident:\n",
      "A damp related survey is requested following previous\n",
      "issues raised aligned to the health of the dwelling.\n",
      "3.0 Conclusion:\n",
      "On arrival, the author was advised by a relative of the\n",
      "resident (who was at work) the concerns aligns to\n",
      "dampness being observed in areas of the property with\n",
      "stale odours also detected at times. On arrival the property appeared to be in general good order although\n",
      "some areas did display localised spoiling likely due to the overriding condition of the structure.\n",
      "A moisture profile was conducted through the property in order to assist determining a pattern through\n",
      "the dwelling as a whole and not just singular aspects (section 4.0).\n",
      "The readings were elevated in many areas both to internal and external walls. The floor also emitted\n",
      "elevated readings where was possible to the thermoplastic floor tiling and, can be considered a normal\n",
      "phenomena since the tiling will be acting as a DPM for ground moisture in the slab.\n",
      "However, a review of exposed floor areas indicated a number of gaps in the membrane and even some\n",
      "tiles removed resulting in a clear observation of the residual bitumen. This absence of a DPM will enable\n",
      "ground moisture to evaporate into the structure raising the potential for secondary issues. And, as it was\n",
      "notable in a number of areas, it remains highly likely why some areas of the installed timber floor also\n",
      "emitted elevated moisture readings.\n",
      "With this in mind, there remains a feasible problem with the membrane coverage as whole in the property\n",
      "resulting in the elevated readings obtained throughout. Also, in some areas the skirtings emitted elevated\n",
      "moisture levels and could likely be due to their contact with the ground or through the localised walls\n",
      "where they may be in contact with the concrete slab.\n",
      "To the exterior there was evidence of cavity wall insulation (CWI) with a number of drill holes noted and,\n",
      "what cannot be ruled out from the external wall perspective is the overall condition of the CWI in terms\n",
      "of its dampness as this can also act as a bridge for moisture to travel to the inner leaf and wet the internal\n",
      "walls.\n",

      "Whilst on site an assessment was undertaken of the installed ventilation measures with forced extractors\n",
      "installed in the bathroom and kitchen as this can also impact the internal conditions particularly in the\n",
      "colder periods of the year. Of note, trickle vents were installed in these rooms also and, they can also\n",
      "compromise the extractor performance by being able to draw air in from the exterior rather than from the\n",
      "rooms.\n",
      "A test of the bathroom extractor suggested it’s flow rate is compatible with the Part F of the Building Regs\n",
      "when on boost and a secondary boost function which is manually selected. However, for its optimum\n",
      "performance delivery it is recommended guidance is given to the tenant to keep the nearby window closed\n",
      "when this is operating for it to withdraw moist air from the property and not draw air in and straight out\n",
      "from the exterior. In addition, Part F of the Building Regs suggest a 10mm door undercut to enable ‘make-\n",
      "up’ air to be drawn into the bathroom from the dwelling and expel all moist air to the exterior. This door\n",
      "did not comply with the recommendations and hence, after the room is used, the difference in vapour\n",
      "pressure will result in the warm moist atmosphere circulating the property.\n",
      "In the kitchen the wall mounted device was switched off at the isolator and the tested flow rate was not\n",
      "compliant with the applicable regs. Also, with a variable door undercut, using the kitchen will also likely\n",
      "encourage atmospheric moisture to circulate the dwelling raising the potential for secondary issues.\n",
      "To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, there are indeed elevated moisture readings to the majority\n",
      "of the external and internal lower walls and, with notable gaps in the thermoplastic membrane acting as\n",
      "a DPM for ground moisture, the ongoing presence of ground moisture is a likely contributor to the\n",
      "reported damp related issues. This was endorsed by expected high readings taken on the exposed floor\n",
      "confirming its construction hence, it is recommended the floor covering as a whole is checked alongside\n",
      "the removal of all skirtings to assess the presence of a membrane to the lower wall from the floor. The\n",
      "introduction of a liquid DPM cannot be ruled out as a possible option to reduce this issue.\n",
      "In addition, the presence and condition of the CWI should be checked to ensure this is not a contributory\n",
      "factor also to the external walls because the addition of open air bricks can affect their condition.\n",
      "3.1 Recommendations:\n",
      "Landlord:\n",
      "Measures recommended to alleviate moisture/mould related issues at the property and assist you in\n",
      "controlling internal atmospheric conditions include:\n",
      "• Consider uplifting all current floor finishes and skirtings to investigate the presence and integrity\n",
      "of the current thermoplastic DPM.\n",
      "• Confirm the requirement for a consistent membrane coverage and the inclusion of the lower\n",
      "walls.\n",
      "• Inspect the external wall cavities by removing a small number of single bricks to ascertain the type\n",
      "of CWI installed and its current condition such that, if it is compromised and/or wet, its removal\n",
      "should be considered possibly due to the presence of open air bricks.\n",
      "• Review the kitchen and bathroom door undercut for a 10mm gap to aid the extractor\n",
      "performance.\n",
      "• Review the kitchen unit for performance compliance in line with Part F of the building Regs.\n",
      "Tenants:\n",
      "• Keep the trickle vents closed in the Kitchen and Bathroom when the extractors are working.\n",
      "• After use, keep the doors to the kitchen and bathroom closed until the forced extraction has\n",
      "cleared the room of generated atmospheric moisture.\n",
