      "Following instruction from PA Housing, attend the above property to report on current moisture\n",
      "conditions and investigate the cause or causes for the reported elevated structural moisture and\n",
      "associated mould growth.\n",
      "Report\n",
      "1.0 Property:\n",
      "The surveyed property is a semi-detached dwelling likely to\n",
      "have been constructed in and around 1950. In regard to the\n",
      "rear elevation the pattern of brickwork would indicate a\n",
      "cavity wall construction (Stretcher Bond) however, the\n",
      "front elevation and gable end wall would suggest a solid\n",
      "brick construction (Flemish garden wall bond – Sussex\n",
      "bond). A concrete ground supported floor slab was\n",
      "indicated in the surveyed area to the kitchen, rear lobby\n",
      "and toilet.\n",
      "1.1 Period of construction – Concrete floor slabs:\n",
      "In 1965 it became a matter of regulation that ground supported concrete floor slabs should have a DPM\n",
      "(Damp Proof Membrane) in their construction to prevent ground moisture from migrating to the surface\n",
      "of the slab. Prior to this date it was the floor finish which acted as the DPM for example, thermoplastic\n",
      "tiles set on bitumen or wood block flooring set on bitumen etc.\n",
      "2.0 Incident:\n",
      "It was confirmed by the tenant persistent mould growth is an issue in the property affecting mainly the\n",
      "lower rear wall running through the kitchen and adjoining lounge where an area of noticeable damp was\n",
      "noted to the internal wall adjacent to the opening side of the back door (Location B). In addition, damp\n",
      "was reported to be affecting the window reveals in a number of areas around the property including the\n",
      "daughters and sons bedrooms plus landing to the first floor.\n",
      "3.0 Conclusion:\n",
      "There were issues concerning access with the survey being carried out over two days and both having\n",
      "time restrictions limiting the survey mainly to the areas of concern on the ground floor and selected areas\n",
      "to the first.\n",
      "The detailed moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted elevated readings in regard to the lower areas of\n",
      "the ground floor rear wall running through the lounge and kitchen. As detailed the rear wall to the\n",
      "property is of cavity construction (Section 6.3) and as such, if a rising damp issue is affecting the structure\n",
      "then, understanding the integrity of the cavity in regard to bridging of the DPC to the inner leaf plus,\n",
      "detailing in regard to floor structures etc. is critical in understanding the possible routes of moisture\n",
      "migration and appropriate remedial works.\n",

      " Carry out an invasive review of the rear wall to the property in regard to the cavity and\n",
      "detailing/integrity of the associated DPC’s.\n",

      "effective forced ventilation to the kitchen and bathroom areas is essential whereby installed\n",
      "continuous running units with a humidity-controlled boost correctly sized will, in conjunction with\n",
      "the natural permeability of the structure, provide continuous background ventilation to the\n",
      "dwelling. When fan units are specified and installed, follow-up flow rate checks should always be\n",
      "carried out to ensure the units are meeting the designed specification.\n",
      "The continuous combined flow rate of both units ideally should meet the calculated ‘Whole\n",

      "which was completed and occupied circa 2020/2021 of\n",
      "cavity wall construction.\n",
      "2.0 Incident:\n",
      "The residents comprise two adults and one infant and\n",
      "advise experiencing issues through the property including\n",
      "mould mainly in the infants bedroom plus some window\n",
      "reveals alongside a damp reveal and ‘spongy’ floor close to\n",
      "the lounge external door.\n",
      "3.0 Conclusion:\n",
      "Upon arrival the resident advised of concerns mainly to areas of the reveals through habitable rooms\n",
      "however, at the time of the survey, all areas did not display mould and had been treated prior to the\n",
      "survey.\n",
      "A limited moisture profile conducted through the property indicated a dry building fabric. However,\n",
      "elevated readings were noted to the external door reveals in the lounge area at low level.\n",
      "Suffice to add, this was the area of concern to the occupants concerning the floor integrity as it was\n",
      "moving up and down when stepped on possibly suggesting a localized issue.\n",
      "In support of the above, an external assessment of this area readily showed gaps in the render finish and\n",
      "sealant at low level that would enable free water ingress.\n",
      "An excavation of the area close to the window reveal walls, also indicated a clear gap between the\n",
      "installed paving and the property itself (section 6.3). In addition, a gap was also observed with a borescope\n",
      "between the lower brick wall and the floor construction which could enable rainwater to pool in this\n",
      "location running off the high level patio paving potentially leading to the localized internal wet reveal\n",
      "areas and the spongy internal floor with it recommended this area is reassessed for construction\n",
      "effectivity concerning penetrating damp with a French drain considered in place of the open plastic\n",
      "elements currently installed.\n",
      "Regarding ventilation adequacy in the property which could be contributing to the previous reported\n",
      "mould, not all the windows had trickle vents fitted likely aligned to mould in reveals and, a forced extractor\n",
      "was observed in both the open-plan kitchen/lounge and bathroom.\n",
      "On test both extractor devices did not appear to comply with the current regulations and, no contributory\n",
      "mechanisms were noted apart from a single switch in the cupboard to power both devices in a constant\n",
      "running format.\n",
      "In support of extraction efficiency the door undercuts were also noted to be less than the recommended\n",
      "10mm gap between the door underside and floor finish to aid air circulation and resultant extractor\n",
      "performance by drawing air from the property as a whole to aid extracting generated moist air.\n",
      "A thermal assessment did not suggest any issues that could contribute to the reported mould however, a\n",
      "separate issue was noted in the bathroom ceiling that could align to a possible leak from the property\n",
      "above (section 5.1).\n",
      "To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, the problems advised by the occupants are likely due to an\n",
      "absence of ventilation adequacy aligned to the limited trickle vents plus installed extractors and their\n",
      "compliance with existing regulatory measures. In addition inadequate door undercuts can restrict the\n",
      "ability of extractor performance leading to more open doors to clear generated moist air in turn enabling\n",
      "warm moist air to travel the property due to vapour pressure differential leading to mould in the\n",

      "Upon arrival Mr & Mrs Correla were in attendance alongside 3 medium sized dogs which can readily align\n",
      "to the effectiveness of ventilation measures due to the internal atmospheric moisture being generated.\n",
      "A moisture profile conducted through the property as a whole confirmed a dry construction however, in\n",
      "areas of suggested elevated readings, they are sporadic and each can have a likely reason. In the bathroom\n",
      "a high low level reading could align to an issue in the cavity wall with potential wet insulation and could\n",
      "similarly be the case by the kitchen door. In the kitchen cupboard a wet wall reading could align to recent\n",
      "repairs appearing to the mortar and brickwork close the window and is taking its time to dry naturally. In\n",
      "the lounge, the window reveal being an area of staining is a concern to the residents and a check across\n",
      "the elevation suggested raised readings when close to the window only. From an external perspective,\n",
      "this could likely align to a visible gap between the concrete plinth and the uPVC window beneath it. Suffice\n",
      "to add, the resident showed the author an image taken after rainfall whereby their plinth remained wet\n",
      "at the base above the window and the same construction next door was dry.\n",
      "In addition, at low level around the circumference of the property a concrete skirt was noted that may be\n",
      "breaching the installed DPC. This can, with cavity wall insulation (CWI) lead to damp bridging across the\n",
      "cavity and is recommended this is checked and confirmed by respective experts.\n",
      "There was no evidence of mould development at the time of the survey and, an assessment of installed\n",
      "ventilation measures was undertaken to determine the ‘adequacy’ of their intention. In the bathroom a\n",
      "forced extraction unit runs continuously with a boost function aligned to relative humidity levels which\n",
      "was not determined at the time.\n",
      "In the kitchen a similar unit runs continuously with a pull cord boost function with the resident also\n",
      "advising it has a relative humidity function setting not checked at the time.\n",
      "Both units operate below the current recommendations specified in Part F of the Building Regs and ideally\n",
      "should be assessed for flow rate compliance. Passive trickle vents were observed and could be regarded\n",
      "as sufficient for this aspect.\n",
      "To the exterior of the kitchen extractor, it was noted to vent through a passive wall plate which was also\n",
      "partly blocked by clear silicone. A borescope did not confirm the presence of any ducting and can align to\n",
      "warm moist air being vented into the cavity as well as the exterior to a degree. It is recommended this is\n",
      "inspected and resolved so as not to impair the suggested cavity wall insulation (CWI) polystyrene beads.\n",
      "In both bedrooms a large passive wall plate was noted that in the opinion of the author will have an\n",
      "adverse effect on the localized internal environment and, can serve to locally cool the structure where\n",
      "they are installed leading to significant surface temperature differences and a likely location for mould\n",
      "due to periods of condensation. With open trickle vents observed, these additional passive devices will\n",
      "likely increase the coolness of their room locations.\n",
      "To the exterior we understand there have been repairs conducted to areas of pointing with additional\n",
      "passive plates also sealed with clear silicone evident.\n",
      "However, even with any defects noted to the exterior finish, rainwater would still have to find its way to\n",
      "the inner leaf to cause internal issues and, in this case could use installed CWI as a ‘bridge’. And, potential\n",
      "bridging of the DPC could also contribute to this issue.\n"
