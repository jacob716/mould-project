       "'Our ref: Author: S3\\nName Client\\nAddress BN17 Contact\\nDate of visit 15th July 2025\\nTime of visit 09:30 Hrs\\nScope\\nFollowing instruction from ……………………., attend the above property to undertake a damp related survey\\nto aid reported ongoing issues.\\nReport\\n1.0 Property:\\nThe property is a ground floor one-bedroom flat of cavity\\nwall construction and a solid floor.\\n2.0 Incident:\\nA damp related survey is requested following previous\\nissues raised aligned to the health of the dwelling.\\n3.0 Conclusion:\\nOn arrival, the author was advised by a relative of the\\nresident (who was at work) the concerns aligns to\\ndampness being observed in areas of the property with\\nstale odours also detected at times. On arrival the property appeared to be in general good order although\\nsome areas did display localised spoiling likely due to the overriding condition of the structure.\\nA moisture profile was conducted through the property in order to assist determining a pattern through\\nthe dwelling as a whole and not just singular aspects (section 4.0).\\nThe readings were elevated in many areas both to internal and external walls. The floor also emitted\\nelevated readings where was possible to the thermoplastic floor tiling and, can be considered a normal\\nphenomena since the tiling will be acting as a DPM for ground moisture in the slab.\\nHowever, a review of exposed floor areas indicated a number of gaps in the membrane and even some\\ntiles removed resulting in a clear observation of the residual bitumen. This absence of a DPM will enable\\nground moisture to evaporate into the structure raising the potential for secondary issues. And, as it was\\nnotable in a number of areas, it remains highly likely why some areas of the installed timber floor also\\nemitted elevated moisture readings.\\nWith this in mind, there remains a feasible problem with the membrane coverage as whole in the property\\nresulting in the elevated readings obtained throughout. Also, in some areas the skirtings emitted elevated\\nmoisture levels and could likely be due to their contact with the ground or through the localised walls\\nwhere they may be in contact with the concrete slab.\\nTo the exterior there was evidence of cavity wall insulation (CWI) with a number of drill holes noted and,\\nwhat cannot be ruled out from the external wall perspective is the overall condition of the CWI in terms\\nof its dampness as this can also act as a bridge for moisture to travel to the inner leaf and wet the internal\\nwalls.\\nWhilst on site an assessment was undertaken of the installed ventilation measures with forced extractors\\ninstalled in the bathroom and kitchen as this can also impact the internal conditions particularly in the\\ncolder periods of the year. Of note, trickle vents were installed in these rooms also and, they can also\\ncompromise the extractor performance by being able to draw air in from the exterior rather than from the\\nrooms.\\nA test of the bathroom extractor suggested it’s flow rate is compatible with the Part F of the Building Regs\\nwhen on boost and a secondary boost function which is manually selected. However, for its optimum\\nperformance delivery it is recommended guidance is given to the tenant to keep the nearby window closed\\nwhen this is operating for it to withdraw moist air from the property and not draw air in and straight out\\nfrom the exterior. In addition, Part F of the Building Regs suggest a 10mm door undercut to enable ‘make-\\nup’ air to be drawn into the bathroom from the dwelling and expel all moist air to the exterior. This door\\ndid not comply with the recommendations and hence, after the room is used, the difference in vapour\\npressure will result in the warm moist atmosphere circulating the property.\\nIn the kitchen the wall mounted device was switched off at the isolator and the tested flow rate was not\\ncompliant with the applicable regs. Also, with a variable door undercut, using the kitchen will also likely\\nencourage atmospheric moisture to circulate the dwelling raising the potential for secondary issues.\\nTo conclude, it is the opinion of the author, there are indeed elevated moisture readings to the majority\\nof the external and internal lower walls and, with notable gaps in the thermoplastic membrane acting as\\na DPM for ground moisture, the ongoing presence of ground moisture is a likely contributor to the\\nreported damp related issues. This was endorsed by expected high readings taken on the exposed floor\\nconfirming its construction hence, it is recommended the floor covering as a whole is checked alongside\\nthe removal of all skirtings to assess the presence of a membrane to the lower wall from the floor. The\\nintroduction of a liquid DPM cannot be ruled out as a possible option to reduce this issue.\\nIn addition, the presence and condition of the CWI should be checked to ensure this is not a contributory\\nfactor also to the external walls because the addition of open air bricks can affect their condition.\\n3.1 Recommendations:\\nLandlord:\\nMeasures recommended to alleviate moisture/mould related issues at the property and assist you in\\ncontrolling internal atmospheric conditions include:\\n• Consider uplifting all current floor finishes and skirtings to investigate the presence and integrity\\nof the current thermoplastic DPM.\\n• Confirm the requirement for a consistent membrane coverage and the inclusion of the lower\\nwalls.\\n• Inspect the external wall cavities by removing a small number of single bricks to ascertain the type\\nof CWI installed and its current condition such that, if it is compromised and/or wet, its removal\\nshould be considered possibly due to the presence of open air bricks.\\n• Review the kitchen and bathroom door undercut for a 10mm gap to aid the extractor\\nperformance.\\n• Review the kitchen unit for performance compliance in line with Part F of the building Regs.\\nTenants:\\n• Keep the trickle vents closed in the Kitchen and Bathroom when the extractors are working.\\n• After use, keep the doors to the kitchen and bathroom closed until the forced extraction has\\ncleared the room of generated atmospheric moisture.\\n4.0 Moisture survey:\\n4.1 Moisture map\\n(not to scale):\\n4.2 Structural wall readings:\\nWalls Skirtings Base wall REL(PS)\\nComments\\nLoc. %MC %WME Base Middle Top\\nA 26.0 22.3 317 167 Salts damage at base of wall\\nB 23.9 18.7 229 166\\nC 36.1 In cupboard\\nD 32.1 14.6 220 160\\nE 21.2 245 121 11.4% MC in Boxing\\nF 20.0 172 165\\nG 16.9 8.6 178 167\\nH 30.1 19.4 408 158\\nI 25.7 17.2 228\\nJ 17.1 31.8 890 166\\nK 19.3 10.5 134 131\\nL 20.7 13.2 188 168\\n4.3 Structural floor readings:\\nLoc. %MC REL(PS) Comments\\n1 22.1 Into wood floor finish\\n2 18.7\\n3 999 Onto thermoplastic tiles and is likely normal ground moisture\\n4 286 Onto vinyl\\n5 29.6\\n6 15.9 Into timber floor finish\\n7 391 Onto thermoplastic tiles\\n8 20.9\\n9 21.4\\n10 229 Non-invasive readings on vinyl surface\\nHigh Moisture Levels\\nModerate Moisture Levels\\nLow Moisture Levels\\n4.4 Atmospheric conditions:\\nLocation Relative Humidity % Air Temp oC Dew Point Temp oC Specific Humidity g/Kg\\nExterior 75.0 19.6 15.0 10.4\\nHallway 70.5 24.1 18.4 12.7\\nKitchen 61.5 24.8 16.9 11.5\\n5.0 Ventilation:\\n5.1 Bathroom extractor:\\nThis continuous running device delivered the following flow\\nrates on test and is considered to be compliant with its\\ncapability for a bathroom:\\nConstant: 6.0 l/s\\nBoost 1: 19.8 l/s\\nBoost 2: 26.2 l/s\\nIt is recommended the trickle vent in this room is closed.\\n5.2 Kitchen extractor:\\nThis device is located away from a cooker hood and was\\nswitched off at the isolator on arrival. On test it delivered a\\nsingle flow rate of 6.1 l/s which is below that recommended\\nfor an extractor in a kitchen situated away from a\\ncookerhood.\\nTwo trickle vents were also noted in this room that can\\nimpact the extractor performance.\\n6.0 Observations:\\n6.1 Hallway – survey location point A:\\nDamage was evident to the lower section of the wall in this\\nlocation and, with elevated moisture readings, it is possible\\nthe wall construction is being impaired by the ground slab\\nand its current damp proofing measures against ground\\nmoisture.\\n6.2 Hallway cupboard – close to survey point B:\\nA visual review of this cupboard clearly shows the absence\\nof thermoplastic tiles that are likely to be acting as the\\ndamp proof membrane for ground moisture in the slab.\\nConsideration should be given to inspecting the entire\\nfloor for an adequate membrane cover that could be\\nreadily contributing to the issues at low level on the walls.\\n6.3 Bathroom:\\nThe lower walls in this location also displayed similar\\nelevated moisture readings however, at the time there\\nappeared to be no leaks and the boxing was measured and\\nfound to be dry.\\nCWI in this external wall should be inspected for its\\nintegrity and whether it is contributing to the issues at low\\nlevel on the external walls.\\n6.4 Threshold to dining area:\\nThe floor covering was exposed in this area and drill holes\\nwere observed in the thermoplastic floor covering that\\nagain, can be a likely contributor to moisture in the lower\\nsections of the dwelling.\\n6.5 Survey location point 6:\\nA reading in the timber floor covering was dry at the time\\nin this location and, the setting aside of a small piece\\nconfirmed the presence of a membrane underneath it that\\nis acting to separate the floor finish from the thermoplastic\\ntiles. The adjoining skirting was wet and is likely due to it\\nbeing in contact with the floor and/or wet wall.\\n6.6 Survey location point J:\\nEvidence of previous gripper rods were noted in the\\nthermoplastic floor finish and, with rusty elements noted,\\nconfirms the installation of the rods penetrated the tile\\nresulting in moisture able to travel up to the interior and,\\nlikely rotting the previous gripper.\\n6.7 Floor finishes:\\nThere are varied floor finishes noted throughout the\\ndwelling and, could align to areas that have either gone\\ninto failure of been lifted to inspect and/or repair.\\nIt is recommended the entire floor finish is lifted to inspect\\nthe thermoplastic damp proof membrane and its alignment\\nto all the skirtings and walls\\n6.7.1 Floor finishes:\\nThis image upholds the comments in 6.7 above with\\ndamage noted to areas of the thermoplastic tiling and\\nvaried timber remediations etc that can suggest a history\\nof damp related issues to the flooring in this property.\\n6.8 Exterior:\\nAn inspection of the exterior did not show any issues with\\npotential bridging of the DPC or rainwater elements that\\nmay be leaking.\\nHowever, there was evidence of drill holes across all the\\nelevations and could suggest the presence of CWI. With this\\nin mind, it is recommended the cavity is accessed by\\nremoving a small number of bricks across the façade in\\norder to check the presence and condition of any CWI\\nbecause open air bricks were observed that can impact the\\nintegrity of installed insulation.\\n7.0 Survey Equipment:\\nNon-destructive moisture readings using:\\nProtimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given\\nnumerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material\\ncharacteristics.

      "moisture conditions. This is supported by both extractors switched off at the time and a working tumble\n",
      "dryer emitting atmospheric moisture into the dwelling.\n",
      "3.2 Recommendations:\n",
      "Landlord:\n",
      "Measures recommended to alleviate moisture related issues at the property and assist the tenants in\n",
      "controlling internal atmospheric conditions include:\n",
      "• Review the kitchen extractor unit to ensure its flow rates are compliant with Part F of the Buildings\n",
      "for this ‘wet’ room.\n",
      " Discuss with the tenant the importance of using the bathroom extractor in boost mode.\n",
      "• Review the Nuaire PIV device for its location and expected performance delivery in this dwelling.\n",
      "• Consider the feasibility of installing an outlet for the tumble dryer to deviate it from being used\n",
      "internally.\n",
      "Tenants:\n",
      "The consideration and control of atmospheric moisture is a priority and can be achieved by ensuring the\n",
      "following points are carried out to optimize the internal atmospheric conditions including:\n",
      "• Using trickle vents and window ventilation as needed. Opening windows can be very effective for\n",
      "short periods such as cooking etc when high atmospheric moisture levels will be generated.\n",
      "However, leaving windows open for long periods in cold weather will allow the temperature inside\n",
      "the property to fall and may well make matters worse.\n",
      "• Use extractor fans in boost mode during periods of high moisture production for example, cooking\n",
      "and bathing etc.\n",
      "• Ensure areas of moisture production for example kitchen and bathroom are kept closed from the\n",
      "general environment where possible until the extraction system has reduced the generated\n",
      "atmospheric moisture.\n",
      " Try not to dry laundry in the property. If there are no options available, always provide adequate\n",
      "ventilation by opening windows preferably providing a cross flow of air through the property.\n",
      "During the winter months when external temperatures are low or when security is an issue,\n",
      "drying small volumes of clothing in the bathroom with the door closed and bathroom extractor\n",
      "working would be the best option.\n",
      " Use trickle vents to assist with background ventilation of the property.\n",
      " Tumble dryers should always be used and maintained as specified by the manufacturer and\n",
      "vented to the exterior.\n",
      " Where possible set contents back from external walls by a few inches to uphold air circulation\n",
      "and reduce the potential for condensation leading to mould.\n"

      "Conclusion\n",
      "A number of moisture readings were recorded throughout the property which did not reveal any elevated levels that could suggest structural\n",
      "dampness.\n",
      "With regard to how this property is ventilated there are working mechanical extraction units in the downstairs kitchen, downstairs WC and the\n",
      "upstairs bathroom.\n",
      "All are in working order and run intermittently extracting to the exterior. In addition, a cooker hood is noted, however this does not vent to the exterior\n",
      "and could therefore be a filter mechanism only. From a passive ventilation perspective, at the time of the survey all trickle vents were open.\n",
      "The tenant advised a history of mould in a number of areas however, taking into consideration the very recent completion of redecoration works,\n",
      "the only mould evident was considered to be minor and found within bedroom 1 and at the base of the wall in the lounge.\n",
      "However, the tenant did produce photographic evidence confirming her concerns.\n",
      "The thermal survey set out below clearly confirms that either condensation was active or, conditions were as such at wall surfaces mould is able\n",
      "to be sustained when conditions persist for periods of time.\n",
      "In conclusion based upon a dry structure and observations made and the thermal survey, it is the opinion of the author issues raised by the tenant\n",
      "are associated by periods of elevated humidity levels and inadequate ventilation.\n",
      "This is supported by drying clothes internally, leaving doors open of wet rooms (kitchen and bathroom) after use and insufficient door undercuts\n",
      "which provide air circulation through the property but more importantly, increase the performance of extraction devices with make-up air being\n",
      "drawn in collecting the moist air for its removal.\n",

      "Landlord\n",
      "The following suggested works will allow the tenants to better control the humidity levels in the property and the subsequent mould activity:\n",
      "Review the installed ventilation fans and remediate as required.\n",
      "It is the opinion of the author, providing continuous mechanical extract ventilation of the dwelling is the most appropriate way forward and\n",
      "would essentially involve having extract fans in the kitchen, bathroom and toilet running continuously with a boost function (ideally automatic\n",
      "via integral humidity control function and light function in the toilet) to provide increased ventilation if and when required, for example during\n",
      "cooking and bathing/showering etc. The air extracted by the fans would be replaced by outside air drawn in via a combination of the existing\n",
      "trickle vents and the structure itself.\n",
      "APPROVED DOCUMENT F 2000 - Effective from 2010: specifies the installed extract fans combined should be set up to provide a\n",

      "a continuous background airflow no less than:\n",
      "litres/second with the Boost flow rate as specified in Approved Document F - Effective from 2010\n",
      "31\n",
      "It should be noted in the case of Ø100mm fan units, air flow rates above 8 Litres/Sec. at this diameter they can start to generate noticeable\n",
      "noise levels leading to units being switched off when being run continually. If the ventilation system is to be upgraded, it would be prudent to\n",
      "install a Ø150mm unit in the kitchen.\n",
      "Any ventilation works must only be carried out by appropriately qualified contractors as there are a number of regulatory requirements which\n",
      "will apply to the works we are recommending.\n",
      "Ensure all door undercuts are a minimum 10mm between the door underside and floor finish as recommended in Part F of the Building Regs\n",
      "to aid air circulation and make-up air entering the bathroom and kitchen aiding the extraction of moist air.\n",
      "Discuss with the tenant the importance of a balance of heating and ventilation to achieve optimum internal conditions whilst also dispelling\n",
      "warm moist internal air to the exterior particularly in the kitchen and bathroom. In addition, opening windows to clear overnight condensation\n",
      "is also a consideration for a short period of time.\n",
      "Discuss with the tenant setting contents back from external walls to allow for adequate atmospheric circulation behind and reduce the\n",
      "potential for condensation to occur.\n",
      "Review the loft insulation for an adequate and even coverage TO the eaves but not in them.\n",
      "Tenants\n",
      "The consideration and control of atmospheric moisture is a priority and can be achieved by ensuring the following points are carried out which\n",
      "will optimize the internal atmospheric conditions (select as req’d):\n",
      "Use of extractor fans once installed during periods of high moisture production, for example when cooking and bathing.\n",
      "Ensuring areas of moisture production such as the bathroom, are kept closed from the general environment until the extraction system has\n",
      "reduced the excessive atmospheric moisture levels.\n",
      "Try not to dry laundry in the property. If there are no options available, always provide adequate ventilation by opening windows preferably\n",
      "providing a cross flow of air through the property. During the winter months when external temperatures are low or when security is an issue,\n",
      "drying small volumes of clothing in the bathroom with the door closed and bathroom extractor working would be the best option.\n",
      "When cooking put lids on saucepans, when possible, to reduce evaporation.\n",
      "And if possible, move furniture in the property to prevent the buildup of areas of still cold air against exterior walls.\n",

      "known level of water activity at which mould can be active is 0.61. In general, this level collates to an atmospheric relative humidity (RH) of 61%.\n",
      "Condensation does not have to form on a surface. For there to be sufficient moisture to allow mould to become established at the point where\n",
      "condensation occurs, the relative humidity will be 100%.\n",
      "Moulds are simple fungi from several groupings in the fungal classification system. Sexual reproduction in some fungi allows genetic modification\n",
      "to adapt and tolerate changes in the environment such as humidity, temperature, and food requirements.\n",
