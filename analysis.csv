Additionally, the absence of a proper damp proof membrane (DPM) in the concrete floor slab, combined with potential internal leaks from plumbing and external water ingress, contributes to moisture accumulation within the structure. The combination of these factors creates an environment where mould can thrive, exacerbated by the tenant's occupancy conditions that may generate excess moisture.",0818_PO5.pdf
"The reported issues of elevated moisture and mould growth are primarily caused by inadequate damp proofing measures in the property's construction, as it predates regulations requiring damp proof membranes and courses. Additionally, poor ventilation in areas such as the ensuite shower room and the utility room contributes to moisture accumulation, while the practice of drying laundry indoors exacerbates condensation problems, particularly on the engineered wood flooring.",0994_W2.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the flat are poor ventilation, particularly in the bedroom where a clothes horse is set up, leading to increased internal humidity levels. Additionally, the bathroom has a passive vent with no airflow, which further contributes to inadequate ventilation. The presence of high relative humidity levels in the bedroom, combined with the cold surface temperatures of the walls, creates conditions conducive to mould growth.",0722_ME4.pdf
"The reported issues of damp and mould in the property are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, particularly due to the kitchen's mechanical extract fan being switched off, which compromises the overall ventilation system. Additionally, there are potential water ingress issues from gaps around the front door threshold and around the waste outlet pipe in the WC, which can contribute to moisture accumulation. The combination of these factors creates an environment conducive to condensation and mould growth.",0528_EX15.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues in the property are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, particularly in the bathroom and bedroom, where extractor fans are not functioning effectively or are turned off. Additionally, the presence of contents against external walls restricts air circulation, leading to cooler areas that can promote condensation. High relative humidity levels, especially in the external environment, further exacerbate the potential for mould growth.",0079_SO16.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation and high humidity levels in the loft, leading to condensation. The presence of a soil stack terminating in the loft may also contribute to moisture ingress from warm, damp air. Additionally, the fungal decay observed in the gutter timber suggests ongoing moisture issues, although rainwater ingress is not a significant factor.",0942_SS3.pdf
"The main causes of the reported mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation and elevated internal humidity levels. The presence of condensation on windows and high moisture readings in various locations indicate poor air circulation, which, combined with the ongoing refurbishment of the building, likely contributes to the damp conditions. Additionally, the blocked passive vent in the kitchen and the lack of continuous mechanical ventilation in the bathroom further exacerbate the moisture retention, creating an environment conducive to mould growth.",0591_LU1.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation leading to elevated internal humidity levels, insufficient air circulation around contents and external walls, and potential missing insulation in certain areas. The presence of moisture in the atmosphere, combined with cooler surface temperatures, creates conditions conducive to mould growth, particularly in areas where ventilation is compromised, such as bedrooms and the bathroom.",0839_RG21.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation, leading to elevated humidity levels, and potential leaks from the heating system contributing to structural dampness. The closed trickle vents and lack of an effective kitchen extractor fan exacerbate moisture retention, while high relative humidity readings in various rooms indicate conditions conducive to mould growth.",0091_TN18.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation and high relative humidity levels. Despite the presence of passive and forced ventilation systems, the bathroom extractor fan was found to be turned off, limiting effective air circulation. Additionally, the high humidity levels, particularly in areas adjacent to colder surfaces, create conditions conducive to mould growth, as the relative humidity often exceeds the threshold necessary for mould proliferation.",0005_CM3.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, leading to increased humidity levels, particularly in the bathroom and bedrooms. Additionally, potential bridging issues in the cavity walls and the presence of external paving slabs that may be obstructing the damp proof course (DPC) contribute to moisture ingress. The compromised air bricks further exacerbate the situation by allowing rainwater to enter the floor void, while interstitial condensation may occur in colder periods due to insufficient insulation.",0635_LU2.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, leading to high humidity levels and condensation, particularly around window reveals and external walls. The reliance on insufficient mechanical extraction and the lack of trickle vents contribute to the accumulation of moisture in the air, exacerbated by activities such as drying laundry indoors. Additionally, the thermal conditions within the property, including cold surfaces and poor air circulation, further facilitate the growth of mould.",0715_ME3.pdf
"The main causes of the reported mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation, particularly in the kitchen and bathroom where extractor fans are absent, leading to elevated humidity levels. Additionally, the lack of a damp proof membrane in the concrete floor slab, due to the property's age, may allow ground moisture to migrate upwards, contributing to the moisture conditions that facilitate mould growth. The combination of these factors creates an environment conducive to mould proliferation, especially on the North facing exterior wall of the bedrooms.",0390_BN12.pdf
"The reported issues of damp and mould in the property are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, particularly in the bathroom and kitchen, where mechanical extraction units are either non-functional or underperforming. Additionally, high internal humidity levels due to activities such as drying clothes indoors and the placement of furniture against external walls contribute to elevated moisture conditions. There are also indications of potential leaks, particularly near the toilet, which may further exacerbate the dampness.",0625_LU2.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate drainage on the balcony above the bay window, leading to water ingress into the structure. Additionally, the presence of interstitial condensation within the ceiling structure, due to thermal bridging and insufficient insulation, contributes to elevated moisture levels. The combination of these factors creates an environment conducive to mould growth, exacerbated by high relative humidity and poor ventilation.",0182_N8.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the property are inadequate ventilation and high relative humidity levels, particularly in the bathroom and kitchen areas. Despite the presence of a centralized mechanical extract ventilation system, it appears to be underperforming, as the tenant has never experienced its boost function. Additionally, the practice of drying laundry indoors without sufficient ventilation contributes to elevated moisture levels, creating an environment conducive to mould growth.",0860_RG42.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues in the property are primarily due to pet urine contamination, which has led to localized staining and damage to the carpeting. Additionally, while the floor construction appears to be adequately designed to prevent moisture ingress from the ground or walls, the presence of hygroscopic moisture in the floor screed suggests that atmospheric moisture may also be contributing to the overall damp conditions, although it is not the primary cause of the carpet issues.",0428_BN21.pdf
