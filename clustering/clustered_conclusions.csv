0121_CO2.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) and showed significant moisture levels were
still present in the loss affected areas of the property. The survey also indicated the loss affected wall
structures were all external and party walls to the neighboring apartments and loss water appears to be
affecting these walls structures from the lower concrete slab construction. Supplied information (Section
6.2) detailed the fact loss water had previously drained into the lower carpark area around the soil stack
which passes down through the surveyed apartment from the property above. The base of the soil stack
was accessed from the kitchen and bathroom areas (Section 6.1) and no obvious leaks or water damage
was noted. In addition there did not appear to be any damage to the plasterboard wall structures
associated with the boxing to the soil stack running down through the surveyed apartment.
All observations made would suggest this is a plumbing related issue and in addition, the fact the flow of
loss water into the lower car park area has ceased, would suggest the original cause has been addressed
and the moisture detected is residual and will therefore reduce over time as the property dries
naturally.",0
0261_TA6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicted in general that with exception of some of the skirtings, the
wall structures displayed dry readings. Both the bathroom and kitchen had a vinyl floor covering adding
to the performance of the thermoplastic floor tile DPM present and would indicate the DPM is effective
within this property at present.
It is the author’s opinion the floor is likely to be a ground supported concrete slab and the thermoplastic
floor tiles are likely to be acting as a DPM within the structure. That being the case, high non-invasive
floor readings and elevated skirting readings are therefore likely to be ground moisture. Subsequently
with no internal damage evident there is no current cause for concern at this property as the tiles are
still performing their primary function. To accurately confirm the construction, a localized excavation of
the floor slab would be required.
The neighbouring property was noted to be 9 courses of brick higher and a vertical DPC could not be
ascertained (see section 5.1).
During the survey it was noted the door separating the kitchen and lounge had been removed allowing
the free flow of condensation from cooking to dissipate between both rooms. Additionally the tenant
confirmed that he dries his laundry in the hallway twice a week, further adding moisture into the
property. Despite the addition of excess moisture into the building there were no areas of concern or
indications of any related issues.
The extractor in the bathroom was an Energysaver™ Sensamatic (Section 5.5) however it was not in
operation at the time of survey. The type of unit fitted operates via RH settings and aligns to the tenant
input that it operates after the switch has been turned off following immediate use of the bathroom. All
windows had trickle vents fitted and were in the closed position during the survey. It was also noted
there was no extractor fitted to the kitchen.",1
0021_GU19.pdf,"A moisture survey was undertaken throughout the flat which confirmed a dry structure and, regarding
how the flat is currently being ventilated, other than relying on the tenant opening windows there is a
working mechanical extraction and heat recovery unit installed with vents within the ceiling in all rooms.
Internal observations revealed mould outbreaks on contents with the tenant confirming they have had
to dispose of a number of items over the years. In addition, musty odours were clearly apparent
throughout the flat with clothing being dried mainly within the kitchen/lounge area and a number of
contents items evident in front of external wall surfaces.
The thermal imagery survey (section 5.0) revealed cooler areas between contents and wall structures
and, calculations made revealed current humidity levels at wall surfaces are sufficient to sustain a wide
variety of moulds.
In conclusion it is the opinion of the author based upon observations made and a dry structure recorded
any outbreak of mould can be attributed to elevated internal humidity levels and inadequate
ventilation. This is supported by the fact mould on contents items can only be sustained elevated
atmospheric moisture levels.",3
0203_PO9.pdf,"There are two adults and two children living at the property with one adult and the younger child
present for the majority of the day.
There are 14 washing loads processed per week, dried with the aid of a condenser dryer located in the
conservatory.
We are advised the odd item of clothing is dried on the radiator at the rear of the property in the
lounge.
There are no mechanical extraction units in the property, there is however a passive vent in the kitchen.
We note one trickle vent which is located within the bathroom; there is therefore very little ventilation
within the property as a whole.
There are a number of contents being stored on external walls, notably within the main bedroom at the
front of the property.
At the time of the survey, no condensation was present.
Mould noted at the time of the survey all relate to external walls, mainly in the hall, conservatory and
main bedroom.
A detailed moisture map was created at various location points throughout the property and, at the
time of our visit, no high moisture readings were recorded.
In conclusion, it is the opinion of the author conditions noted are most likely due to a lack of ventilation
within the property. Contents being stored on external walls are also likely to contribute to reported
issues as it does not allow for natural ventilation to occur.",3
0186_NW2.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey carried out revealed that all areas at the time of survey were dry with the
exception to two small isolated areas which is believed not to have any relevance to the investigation
(see Section 5.0). The property has been stood vacant for some considerable time and is undergoing
some alterations the two small areas that recorded slight elevated REL readings have no evidence of
moisture ingress.
Following our investigation it is the opinion of the author that due to the south west facing aspect and
the construction being uninsulated metal/aluminium allowing condensation to occur. Surface moisture
is then able to migrate down the structure settling on the 18mm chipboard floor.
The area of damage is localised to the corner which is constructed of plastic coated aluminium framed
sealed units fixed to steel vertical beams thus able to create a greenhouse effect
During our survey all ventilation points were checked and were found to be trickle vents with forced air
ventilation to the bathroom and en-suite. Some of the trickle vents were fastened closed and the forced
air units with the bathrooms only had an over run of 65 seconds.",1
0038_LU3.pdf,"The tenant has resided at flat for 12 years and reports dampness in the lounge to the corner of the
external walls along with the development of mould during the period. He is very specific with regards
to his concerns of the issues raised.
A moisture profile of the structure was carried out to all accessible areas and some elevated readings
were noted (section 4.0).
With regard to controlling atmospheric conditions, there are no extraction units in the flat and trickle
vents were noted some of which were open at the time of the survey. Passive vents within the kitchen
cupboards are noted and will introduce cooler air into this location. We understand the tenant dries
washed clothes on the radiators which will add a significant moisture load to the internal atmospheric
conditions.
We are advised the council has recently re-artexed and emulsioned a section of ceiling in the lounge and
observations suggest that at the time of redecoration the concrete ceiling may not have been dry with
paint affected water droplets noted to the ceiling (section 6.1.2).
Mould was noted to areas of the ceiling in the open-plan kitchen and is close in location to the external
wall and balcony area above. Within the lounge the main concern relates to the balcony above and
observations made along with recorded moisture readings suggest that water may be able to migrate
into the flat from this balcony and further investigation is recommended.
It is the opinion of the author the presence of mould through a number of areas of the flat is mainly
driven by internal atmospheric conditions and the lack of ventilation and adequate heating.
Passive vents and a gap beneath the front door serve to introduce cooler air from the exterior and, with
ongoing internal activities, leads to the prevailing conditions for mould growth.
In addition, it is also the opinion of the author that external defects including the balcony and defects
noted to the brickwork (section 6.4.1) could also be contributing to a damp and colder structure.",3
0104_BN18.pdf,"We understand two adults and five children moved into the property in December 2014 with the adults
currently not working at present. There are 7 washing loads processed per week and dried with the aid
of a tumble dryer which is located in the shed and no clothing is reported to be dried within the house.
At the time of our survey condensation was noted to a number of the uPVC Windows and to the
underside of the loft hatch. Widespread mould was also noted at time to the majority of the rooms on a
number of the external walls and ceilings.
At the time of the survey there were a couple of windows slightly open as were some of the trickle
vents. There are two extraction units in the property both operating via pull cords separate to the light
switches. On test the 100mm diameter Kitchen extractor recorded a flow rate of 0.4 m/s which equates
to 3.14 l/s. This is below the current recommended flow rate of 29 l/s when located adjacent to a hob
and 59 l/s when located elsewhere.
The 100mm diameter bathroom extractor recorded a flow rate of 0.8 m/s which equates to 6.28 l/s and
is also below the current recommended flow rate of 15 l/sec when located in a bathroom. Both units
were noted to be in a poor condition and no overruns were recorded where 15 minutes is a current
recommendation for both extraction units when switched off.
A visual inspection of the loft was made and condensation was noted forming on the underside of the
hatch itself. Atmospheric readings were recorded within the loft area which gave a very high RH reading
indicating high moisture levels present in the atmosphere. Also noted was 3”- 4"" of insulation only. With
the humidity levels close to that externally, there is adequate airflow in the loft and good insulation is
recommended.
A thermal imaging survey showed a number of cold areas on the external walls with contents placed up
against them. This activity will restrict the natural air flow within the location leading to areas of still air
against cold exterior walls.
The moisture survey in general indicated a dry structure. However, raised moisture levels were recorded
to the corner on the external wall at the rear of the property in the lounge. In this area mould was
evident and damage to the decorative finish. A visual inspection within this area on the outside revealed
some areas of poor pointing. We are to understand from the tenant however that it is within this
location where there was a previous external issue with the guttering.
It is the opinion of the author the conditions noted at the time of our survey are due in the main to a
lack of adequate ventilation within the property with contributing factors being low performing
extraction units and the build-up of cold spots on the external walls throughout the property. In
addition, the lack of adequate insulation within the loft space is likely leading to cold bridging being a
contributory factor for mould development at the wall/ceiling junction.",3
0157_LE7.pdf,"A moisture survey found the property to be generally in a dry condition across all wall and areas with
the exception of the corner of the bedroom as identified in the previous survey report completed by
Wilson Associates.
There are signs of slightly raised moisture levels detected in the laminate flooring along the perimeter of
the master bedroom, study and lounge along the external wall fronting onto the garden area. It is
difficult to obtain true moisture levels as the laminate laid in all areas prevents access to the screed
below. However some moisture is migrating into the laminate which indicates there may not be a
membrane laid or moisture is migrating into the edge of the laminate. Moisture levels are borderline
and at present there does not appear to be any swelling of the laminate boards.
The moisture affecting the internal wall and floor areas may be penetrating moisture which is bridging
the wall construction via the external wall. At the point where the moisture is located there is a section
of slabs located against the external wall where they extend above the DPC. The vertical edge of the slab
has joint mortar applied but the horizontal joint is free of mortar. This will allow rain water to saturate
the brickwork above DPC level and moisture may consequently migrate into the corner eventually
saturating the blockwork. The wall between the affected flat and the adjoining flat may be connected
without a vertical DPC thus allowing moisture to affect the corner of the bedroom. Moisture may then
migrate into the floor slab and travel along the perimeter of the floor areas.
The kitchen has an over hob extractor fan which vents externally. The fan is operated manually and
relies on the occupants operating when cooking and allowing it to run on after cooking to vent humid air
away from the living areas.
The bathroom has an extractor fan fitted. The switch for the fan is located in the hallway and is
independent from the light switch. It is reliant on the occupants operating the fan unit and there is no
overrun. The fan could be heard to be running but there appears to be a blow back flap to prevent
external air venting into the property when the unit is not in use. At the time of our inspection the flap
appeared to be stuck in the closed position when the fan was operating. Consequently moist air will vent
throughout the property and increase the humidity which can lead to conditions favourable for the
formation of mould.
A section of wall plaster above the fan unit showed increased moisture levels. This may be where moist
air is being pressurized up the cable conduit and consequently saturating the adjoining plaster.
It appears that the mould treatment and redecoration
completed prior to the current tenant occupying
the property along with the tenants lifestyle are
currently minimising the occurrence of mould
growth. However there is evidence of mould
growth on the rear panel of the chest of drawers in
the bedroom. This indicates that internal humidity
rather than penetrating damp is an issue.
The paint on the reveal around the bathroom window is peeling and there are raised moisture levels in
the plasterboard. This may in part be related to increased moisture activity in the bathroom but may
also be due to cold bridging occurring from the steel box lintel. Some moisture activity is generally
expected around window reveals but in this case regular occurrence of high humidity will be gradually
saturating the exposed plaster.",1
0019_EX14.pdf,"A number of moisture readings were recorded throughout the property which did not reveal any elevated levels that could suggest structural
dampness.
With regard to how this property is ventilated there are working mechanical extraction units in the downstairs kitchen, downstairs WC and the
upstairs bathroom.
All are in working order and run intermittently extracting to the exterior. In addition, a cooker hood is noted, however this does not vent to the exterior
and could therefore be a filter mechanism only. From a passive ventilation perspective, at the time of the survey all trickle vents were open.
The tenant advised a history of mould in a number of areas however, taking into consideration the very recent completion of redecoration works,
the only mould evident was considered to be minor and found within bedroom 1 and at the base of the wall in the lounge.
However, the tenant did produce photographic evidence confirming her concerns.
The thermal survey set out below clearly confirms that either condensation was active or, conditions were as such at wall surfaces mould is able
to be sustained when conditions persist for periods of time.
In conclusion based upon a dry structure and observations made and the thermal survey, it is the opinion of the author issues raised by the tenant
are associated by periods of elevated humidity levels and inadequate ventilation.
This is supported by drying clothes internally, leaving doors open of wet rooms (kitchen and bathroom) after use and insufficient door undercuts
which provide air circulation through the property but more importantly, increase the performance of extraction devices with make-up air being
drawn in collecting the moist air for its removal.

0046_ME1.pdf,"A number of moisture readings were recorded with the main focus of attention relating to surface areas where mould has formed.
These readings confirmed a dry structure.
With regard to provisions of how the flat is currently being ventilated, there is a working mechanical extraction unit fitted in the bathroom which
is currently non-compliant with building regs part F with no forced ventilation measures in the kitchen.
Passive trickle vents are fitted to the windows with all closed and noted to be in a poor state of repair.
General internal observations throughout the flat revealed mould mainly on external wall surfaces, on the uPVC window frames and internal doors
and associated frames. There was also evidence of mould on contents (see observations).
In addition to the mould, decorative spoiling in the form of staining was apparent on large wall surface areas and is likely to be associated with
periods of surface condensation as highlighted in the thermal imaging section set out below.
External observations did not reveal any areas of concern that could be possible contributor to the internal conditions.
In conclusion the concerns of the tenant are, in the opinion of the author, likely to be driven by periods of elevated internal humidity levels and
inadequate ventilation.
The conclusion is supported by the fact there is no mechanical extraction unit in the kitchen, the unit in the bathroom is operating below the
suggested 15 l/s as highlighted in building regs part F and, is not used by the resident, all trickle vents are in a poor state of repair and closed plus,
current surface conditions as determined in the thermal imaging section indicated condensation was occurring at the time of this survey.
In addition, mould on contents items is only sustained by periods of elevated internal atmospheric moisture and not structural dampness.
With inadequate and non-utilized ventilation measures in a property, when moisture is generated by everyday activities, the moisture laden
warmer air circulates the property as a whole when doors are left open. This is due to difference in vapor pressure whereby higher vapor air
moves to areas of lower vapor in the air and, can lead to the reported issues.

0172_ME5.pdf,"A moisture survey undertaken indicated areas of elevated readings within the skirtings and some walls
at low levels only with one area of heightened readings to the bathroom wall base at survey locations P
& Q backing onto the bedroom wardrobe. In this area it was noted the floor in the bathroom had a
distinct fall towards this wall area and is therefore the authors opinion that any water on the bathroom
floor may have been pooled at this wall/floor junction over a period of time and capillarity may have
introduced moisture into the wall fabric.
Due to the age of the property and the year of construction, the floor finishes may be acting as the DPM
in areas. With noticeable damage to the poured bitumen floor in areas close to the walls possibly due as
a result of hammering nails into the floor during the installation of gripper rods, it is recommended the
floor is repaired. Additionally, the skirtings appeared to be partially buried in the DPM and can therefore
potentially absorb ground moisture. It may be advantageous to remove the skirting’s, apply a liquid
DPM and/or repair the areas of the poured bitumen layer (section 6.3) and replace the skirting’s with a
gap between the two.
All trickle vents were fully working and appeared to be in good order and the 100mm diameter extractor
in the kitchen was extracting at 3.6 m/s providing sufficient extraction to the kitchen however there was
no extractor in the bathroom. At the time of survey, work was ongoing in the loft area.
A thermal survey concluded condensation was not occurring at the time of the survey but the
temperatures were close. Fitted floor finishes and a balance of heat in the property during occupation
should ensure adequate internal atmospheric conditions.
Externally there did not appear to be any defects that would readily contribute to moisture ingress to
the inner leaf of the property and hence any related internal issues. Although some drill holes were
noted, the presence of CWI and its integrity was not confirmed.",1
0062_PO3.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating in general a dry structure with
particular attention in regard to the areas of concern highlighted by the tenant and detailed on the floor
plan.
However, damp was noted to the floor slab in the bathroom focused on the bath although no obvious
issues were noted and, it may well be prudent to carry out plumbing checks in these areas. The noted
damp under the vinyl flooring to the bathroom would not be a driver for the mould affecting the
property.
It is the opinion of the author, the source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate is
atmospheric and in general, this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of
the installed ventilation.
Issues were highlighted with the installed ventilation to the bathroom which needs to be addressed
(Section 6.1.4).
Observations would also suggest there is an issue with the provision in regard to meeting the ‘Whole
dwelling ventilation rate’ as detail in part F of the building regs.",3
0042_LU4.pdf,"A moisture survey of the property was undertaken (See section 4.0) which revealed all bedrooms and
the bathroom to be dry at the time of the survey, which would point to the mould noted in these areas
being driven by atmospheric conditions in the property.
However, elevated moisture readings were noted to the external wall within the kitchen with off-scale
readings recorded to the exterior wall behind the washing machine which extends to a height of
approximately 500mm from the floor. This aligns to a panel set into the external wall (section 6.4.1).
Elevated readings were also recorded to the external wall to the rear of the property to a height of
200mm above skirting level and subsequent drilled readings at survey location points A & E revealed
elevated readings to a depth of 30mm of the inner leaf of the wall.
Due to the moisture noted to the kitchen wall the exterior was investigated revealing a rendered
decorative panel terminated with a bellcast profile above an identified DPC (Section 6.4.1).
Elevated floor readings were noted within the kitchen with the surveyor of the opinion that, with this
being the only area of solid flooring throughout the house and, no damage noted to the tile finish at the
time of the survey, this likely relates to ground moisture due to the suggested age of the property
(Section 1.1).
A visual inspection of the loft revealed 50mm of insulation which does not appear to extend to the eaves
however, a full view was not able to be made due to the amount of contents present. A thermal image
(section 5.2) revealed cold bands to the top of the external walls and associated ceiling likely to be
indicative of gaps in the insulation leading to cooler areas and the potential onset of condensation and
mould.
With regard to the reported mould activity affecting the structure it is the opinion of the author this is
being driven by atmospheric moisture levels in the property, which in tern will tend to be driven by
occupational activity and issues with effective ventilation of the property.",1
0205_RG27.pdf,"Structural moisture levels recorded through the loss affected area (Section 4.0) indicated in general a
dry structure. However Elevated resistance readings (%WME) were recorded in relation to the concrete
block work forming the inner leaf of the cavity wall.
The atmospheric moisture levels recorded in the property at the time of the survey (Section 4.3)
combined with the thermal survey (Section 4.3.1) suggested condensation and in particular interstitial
condensation is a major factor in the mould development indicated. Ongoing interstitial condensation
combined with a possible natural conductivity in relation to the block work is the most likely reason for
the raised %WME readings recorded. The exterior wall to the loss affected area is North East facing plus
the external vegetation will prevent the wall structure benefitting from the warming effect of the sun.
It was noted two large plastic storage boxes are normally kept in the loss affected corner of the
wardrobe these will greatly affect the air movement in this area which can also be a factor in the
development of mould. In addition to the issues noted in the wardrobe it was also noted the en-suite
bathroom is in close proximity to the loss affected area, the bathroom will be a significant source of
atmospheric moisture.
As requested the cavity in the party wall survey location ‘B’ was accessed (Section 5.1) this confirmed
the cavity was free from debris. It is the opinion of the author the mould issues being experienced in the
surveyed area are driven by atmospheric conditions, which in turn are driven by occupational activity.",1
0159_LU1.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the affected areas only, as requested. This
confirmed a dry structure apart from a moisture reading taken on the resilient kitchen floor which, is
likely to be part of the DPM to ground moisture.
Regarding ventilation measures, there are trickle vents to all windows with all closed at the time.
Mechanical extraction units are installed in the bathroom and kitchen however, the malfunctioning
kitchen unit requires attention (section 6.4). In addition, passive vents are installed in the bedrooms with
bedroom 3 appearing to vent to the exterior.
As part of the moisture profiling in line with BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in
buildings: Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied buildings, a “moist “occupancy was
calculated Section 4.6) and aligns to the current internal humidity levels.
Observations revealed current outbreaks of mould and, attention should be drawn to section 6.8 in
regard to mould activity and the conditions needed for such outbreaks.
In conclusion based upon observations made, a review of the thermal images and a dry structure, it is
the opinion of the author issues highlighted are likely to be a combination of periods of inadequate
ventilation and elevated internal humidity levels. This is also supported by the BS5250:2002 assessment
undertaken (section 4.6) at the time, a malfunctioning kitchen extractor and the thermal imaging survey
(section 5.0) clearly highlighting colder surfaces. In addition, drying clothes internally is noted and,
mould on contents is only sustained by internal atmospheric moisture levels.

the naked eye. Within a closed environment, these can affect respiratory systems of occupants and in
some cases represent a significant health hazard. It is recommended any mould outbreaks are dealt with
in a timely manner using an appropriate fungicide or similar product in accordance with manufacturers
guidelines.",3
0284_TN37.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in relation to the wall structures, the areas which have been
dry lined display dry readings where indicated to the plasterboard which would be expected. In regard
to the wall structures which have been rendered and plastered, readings suggested the remedial works
are effective. At survey location ‘E’ to the hallway remedial works have not recently been undertaken
and salts analysis carried out indicated high nitrate and chloride levels which tend to suggest a ground
related moisture source affecting the structure (Section 6.2).
The floor structure consists of a chipboard floating floor over a heavy gauge DPM and underlying
thermal insulation. In areas where the lower membrane is not isolating the chipboard flooring from the
wet wall structure, damp was migrating into the flooring (Section 6.5). As well as damp migrating into
the floors it is also affecting skim plasters in a number of areas for example, adjacent to the bath and
behind the door to the middle bedroom.
The plumbed systems through the property are drained down with radiators and bathroom fixings
removed. Previous significant water leaks in the bathroom area were reported. The concrete floor slab
under the chipboard flooring and insulation appears to be saturated and due to the age of the property
it is likely the lower concrete does not benefit from a DPM in its construction (Section 6.3). It is
recommended restorative drying is carried out to remove the excessive water indicated in the floor
structure.
The electrical system was not functioning at the time of the survey which prevented the effectiveness of
the extraction fan being confirmed. Both the bathroom and kitchen areas are internal relying on the fan
units for their ventilation. Effective ventilation is required to control the internal humidity levels.",1
0031_LU1.pdf,"Mould and damp were reported within the bedroom directly above the hall with condensation evident
to the UPVC window. It was advised less than a year ago a contractor applied a mould treatment to the
external wall within the hall and bedroom 1. The tenant advised no further issues should occur, so they
wallpapered the hallway only for the mould to return.
Mould within the hallway was noted at the base of the external wall by the front door. Condensation
was evident to the window in this area with a draft coming through this would explain the lower
temperature recorded in this area.
Mould was evident at base level within bedroom 1 directly above the hallway. Mould was also noted
around the window where condensation could be seen to be occurring at the time of the survey.
The tenant brought an element of mould within the bathroom to the attention of the surveyor.
Within the kitchen a condenser dryer was in use with high RH levels recorded. Condensation could be
seen occurring to the kitchen window along with traces of mould.
A 100mm extraction unit was evident within the bathroom which operates via the light switch with an
overrun of 15 minutes. The unit has a flow rate of 0.6 MS which equates to 27.1 minutes to complete
one complete air change the overrun therefore should possibly be adjusted.
A cooker hood extraction unit was present within the kitchen with it being noted that this has a three-
speed function.
Within the bedroom three passive vents along with trickle vents were noted most of which were closed
and require cleaning.
It was advised that two adults and three children reside at the property with 2/3 wash loads processed
per week.
A moisture profile of the affected area revealed slight elevated readings only at survey location point A
where mould was noted (See section 4.3). Drilled readings were recorded at this location point at two
different depths revealing a dry reading further into the structure
In conclusion the surveyor is of the opinion that the mould and condensation reported is likely related to
atmospheric moisture levels within the property.
It is recommended that the front door is inspected as it appears cold air is coming through when closed
resulting in a build up of cold areas on external walls in areas where mould has developed. A further
consideration should be given to adding an RH controlled extraction unit within the kitchen.",3
0216_SE4.pdf,"The moisture survey undertaken (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry structure and certainly no
significant structural moisture sources were identified which would be a likely driver for the fungal
activity. Below the communal hallway adjoining the loss affected bathroom areas to flat 1, the bathroom
has a ceiling mounted extractor fan and observations made to the exterior of the property and in the
floor void to the hallway failed to identify the exhaust ducting for the extractor fan unit (Sections 6.1 and
6.4). Observations made in regard of the fungal growth showed it was growing across the top of the
joists with significant rot affecting the lower areas plus the remaining floorboard nails were rusty
(Section 6.3). Dry readings were noted in regard to the timber floor structure at the time of the survey.
It is the opinion of the author the moisture driving the fungal growth is atmospheric originating in the
bathroom of the Flat 1, and being delivered into the floor structure by the extractor fan to the bathroom
which appears to not be vented to the exterior. Fungal growth in general needs a sustained moisture
source and is why in the opinion of the author, the mould only appears to be affecting the top of the
floor joists plus growing across the fibreglass insulation between and beneath the floor boards which
have been removed. It is believed condensation driven by the damp air from the lower bathroom was
forming on the underside of the loss affected floorboards and would wet the insulation which is likely to
have remained sufficiently damp until the bathroom below was used again. Opening the floor structure
has removed the conditions allowing the affected areas of the timber floor to dry out.
It is the opinion of the author the airbrick previously sighted would have assisted in venting the floor
structure however this is not the driver for the fungal activity.",1

Following instruction from…………………, attend the above property to report on current moisture
conditions and detail ventilation provision at the property.
Report
1.0 Properties:
The property is a ground floor flat in a purpose built block
likely dating from the late 1930’s. Solid brick construction
with a ground supported concrete floor slab throughout.
2.0 Incident:
The detailed property was in a group of properties which
are being surveyed and remotely monitored to allow a
clear understanding of previously reported and or
currently on-going moisture related issues such as mould
activity.
3.0 Conclusion – Interim report:
Remote monitoring is on-going at the property however significant structural moisture levels were
noted through the property which appear to be focused on the bathroom and in particular the bath. It is
the opinion of the author it is likely a plumbing issues is the cause of the moisture levels noted.

0151_HA4.pdf,"A thermal survey has been made of the underfloor heating system at the property in an effort to better
understand the issues being experienced and the concerns of the owners. The thermal survey was
carried out over approximately one hour as the system warmed up. The survey showed in general all the
floor areas to the property are serviced by the system apart from an area adjacent to the breakfast bar
(Section 4.2.3) where there is a clear mismatch between the system and the positioning of the breakfast
bar.
In general the maximum spacing between the heating pipes was 250mm however, in a number of areas
the heating pipes touch and in the hallway appear to run over each other (Section 4.2.5). A noticeable
increase in temperature was noted where pipes were in close proximity to each other and such an area
was noted to the kitchen (Section 4.2.2) at location ‘A’. This is an area of concern for the owners of the
property with the safety of their grandchildren being the main concern.
After an hour, the surface temperature noted to the floor tiles at location ‘A’ was just under 34°C.
Guidelines set out under ‘BS EN 1264 Water based surface embedded heating and cooling systems’
would suggest the indicated temperature is too high. The standard sets a maximum temperature of
29°C for foot comfort.
It was reported the heating system loses pressure and is being topped up from time to time (Section
5.1). It is therefore recommended the system and boiler is inspected so that the reported pressure loss
can be better understood.",1
0126_CR3.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the reported loss affected areas of the property.
High moisture levels were indicated as detailed in the moisture survey (Section 4.0). However the
thermal survey undertaken (Section 5.0) showed condensation to be occurring at the time of the survey
in the areas displaying moisture levels. Through all the survey locations dry structural moisture
conditions were noted with regard to the upper areas of the wall structures and associated ceilings.
Significant issues were noted with regard to ventilation in the surveyed area both passive and forced
(Section 6.0), corresponding atmospheric moisture levels were high leading to raised dew-point levels
through the affected areas. At the time of the survey based on BS 5250:2002 (Code of practice for
control of condensation in buildings) the occupation would be considered to be wet.
Observations would indicate the loss affected wall is of cavity construction and weep holes noted would
indicate the presence of cavity trays in the wall construction which would isolate the surveyed walls
from reported water ingress affecting the exterior wall structures to the floors above (Section 5.3).
It is the opinion of the author the moisture driving the reported mould issues affecting the bathroom
and adjoining bedroom area is atmospheric and as such likely to be driven by occupational activity.",1
0136_DT5.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) in general indicated a dry structure and certainly was the case with
regard to the main areas of concern to the bathroom and rear bedroom. Raised structural moisture
levels were however indicated in a number of areas:
 Adjacent to the bath and likely to be driven by use of the bathroom.
 Behind sink unit to the kitchen. As detailed in the report it is recommended checks are made in
this area with regard to sealing of the sink, work top plus associated plumbing.
 Raised moisture levels were indicated in relation to the floor slab through the property. As
detailed in the report, raised moisture levels may relate to the design of the floor slab in relation
to the age of the property i.e. the location of the DPM to the slab.
With regard to the two main areas of concern for the tenant:
 The bathroom ceiling structure was dry and the pattern of mould was indicative of atmospheric
moisture driven condition. It was reported issues with the loft insulation had previously been
highlighted as an issue in this area. Surface temperature of the ceiling will be a mitigating factor
however the atmospheric moisture in this area is most likely to be the main driver. Issues were
highlighted with the effectiveness of the extractor fan to the bathroom (Section 6.2).
 The damaged ceiling to the rear bedroom was dry, however damage was noted (Section 7.4).
The thermal survey highlighted possible issues with the loft insulation in this area which may
lead to condensation issues (Section 5.2) however observations would tend to suggest an
intermittent water ingress yet external observations did not highlight any obvious issues. The
ceiling is damaged requiring repair and is the recommendation of the author, further checks are
made when the damage section of the ceiling is removed.
It should be noted the ceiling is artexed which is original to the construction of the property
and as such is likely the artex is an ACM (Asbestos Containing Material) and therefore should
be dealt with complying with all relevant legislation.
With regard to atmospheric moisture levels in the property it was noted the passive vent to the kitchen
area has been sealed by the tenant (Section 6.1.2) and there is no forced ventilation provided in this
area. In addition it was noted there is a tumble dryer located in the small store room to the ground floor
which is used and not vented to the exterior (Section 7.6).",1
0229_SS13.pdf,"This report should be read in conjunction with the report relating to the damp survey undertaken on
14th August 2015.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the highlighted areas to the two bedrooms (Section
4.0) and indicated a dry structure. Combined with the thermal survey (Section 6.0) indicated
atmospheric moisture was the driver for the issues being experienced and is the opinion of the author
interstitial condensation driven by the internal atmospheric conditions is the main cause.
Discussions with the tenant and data recorded during the previous survey highlighted issues with the
effectiveness of the extractor unit to the bathroom (Section 7.1) plus issues with the way the units are
being used. Best practice was explained to the tenant which should, combined with an upgrade of the
extractor fan in the bathroom, alleviate the issues being experienced.
With regard to the musty odours to the kitchen units and mould growth on contents it is the opinion of
the author the issues being experienced are being driven by atmospheric conditions (Section 8.1), and
should be addressed by changes in the internal conditions.
A hole was reported to the exterior wall and a review of the area indicated there was no hole in the
brickwork rather the observation related to a drop in the exterior ground level in relation to the lower
rendered panel (Section 8.2).",1
0235_SW12.pdf,"Observations and water testing highlighted an issue with the sealing of the rainwater drainage from the
flat roof above the rear area of the lounge. A buildup of sediment etc. in the system is likely to have
been a mitigating factor. Observations would suggest the fault lies with the connection between the
horizontal drainage pipe from the roof and the internal down pipe at first floor level. This area is likely to
be accessible from behind the built-in wardrobe to the first floor bedroom.",0
0294_W14.pdf,"The final stages of a complete refurbishment of the
property was underway at the time of the survey
including damp remediation works, a new kitchen and
bathroom plus associated plumbing works with a
complete re-dec. throughout.
It is likely much of the moisture indicated in the structure
is related to the refurbishment works or loss moisture
which is now behind the damp remedial works
undertaken.
Developing a clear understanding of the source of the reported loss moisture is problematic considering
the works undertaken. It was reported the main area of concern was the party wall due to the indicated
age of the property, suggested historic works and current damp remedial works undertaken. It may well
be the case the original source of moist was ground related being able to migrate into the structure due
to detailing issues with the original DPC.
Mitie’s Assistant Site Manager had a copy of a report supplied by the damp remediation company
following an investigation carry out prior to their works. It was mentioned the previous investigations
related to the areas of concern and involved invasive investigations of the floor construction. It is the
opinion of the author the report already supplied to Mitie will assist and may well highlight clearly the
moisture related issues.",0

A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the property which revealed a dry structure and, regarding ventilation there are
working mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen plus, trickle vents to the windows. Observations revealed some evidence of
mould mainly relating to the bathroom ceiling and to uPVC window frames.
The tenant’s concern was the main bedroom being noticeably colder than all other rooms however, thermal imaging pictures did not highlight any
issues regarding this although the survey this did conclude there are areas where condensation is a consideration with conditions at wall surfaces
sufficient to sustain mould. This room is north facing and as such its fabric will remain colder year-round hence a possible greater reliance on heating
the room in a consistent manner.
In conclusion, mould issues will in the opinion of the author, be associated with periods of increased humidity levels and inadequate ventilation.
The remote monitoring period to date suggests heating is likely being utilized and that the bedrooms monitored delivered very similar data levels. As
bedroom 2 is north facing, it can inherently be a colder room and would only place a slightly greater emphasis on maintaining heating adequacy in
this room.

advised two washing loads are processed per week which are dried either using a tumbledryer vented to
the exterior or, weather permitting, outside. We are further advised the heating is in regular use.
From a ventilation perspective, the windows do not have trickle vents fitted, only locking handles and
night vents. We note a 100mm automatic forced vent installed in the bathroom, however it was not
working at the time of the survey.
Attending at the time of the survey was a plumber and tradesperson who removed the box work to
expose the problem area. At first the pipes were thought to be the cause of the leak but on further
investigation and with meter readings it was evident the pipes were corroded but not leaking.
The resident from the flat above had reported a leak that has been ongoing for some time and would
appear consistent with the moisture profile of the property.

The hall adjoining wall and floor are also affected approximately 300mm from the entrance to the flat.",0
0063_PO5.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised having a dehumidifier in the master bedroom to help with the ongoing
reported issue and, at the time of the survey the windows and trickle vents were open.
A moisture assessment through the two main areas of concern revealed a number of elevated moisture
readings such that, in order to rule out possible earlier condensation, drilled readings to a depth of approx.
1” were undertaken in some locations with persistent high levels still evident (Section 4.0).
An assessment of the external side wall clearly suggests that retrospective cavity wall insulation has been
injected and includes the front and rear wall locations.
Around the perimeter it would appear the render finish has been amended with a repair segment up to 8
to 10 inches high that has not as yet been decorated. A visual assessment of this finish suggested it is wet.
The side wall to the master bedroom and bedroom 2 showed localized salts damage through its section
below the brick to the first floor. Damaged render finishes can readily allow rainwater to penetrate the
finish but, they do not have the ability to evaporate adequately leading to potential issues with the outer
brickwork remaining wet.
With drilled hole suggesting cavity wall insulation being installed, if the outer leaf brickwork is indeed wet,
it will migrate to the cavity and can lead to wetting of the insulation. Should this indeed be the case, wet
insulation loses its thermal capability leading to the inner leaf walls becoming wet and indeed cold.
With normal everyday moisture generation, when this comes into contact with the colder external walls,
condensation can occur and can show itself as beads or running moisture.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a structural dampness related issue aligned to the
external elevations with particular emphasis on the side wall.
It is recommended a detailed invasive check if this wall is undertaken to confirm the integrity of the
insulation and the true moisture levels within the cavity due to the poor external finish.
Once this investigation has been completed and any remediations undertaken, it is recommended the
elevations as a whole are repaired and redecorated to uphold a repellent feature for rainwater.",1
0066_PO8.pdf,"Several moisture readings were recorded within the ground floor bedrooms with some elevated moisture levels at the
base of wall surfaces noted. At survey point 4 drilled readings recorded a dry level suggesting condensation as a
contributing factor, although drilled readings recorded at survey point 6 were elevated and, a sample has been taken
for independent analysis to aid determining this high recorded level.
There is limited ventilation in the surveyed rooms with no trickle vents fitted to windows hence a reliance on them
being opened. Opposite bedroom 1, connected to bedroom 2 is a bathroom with a mechanical extraction unit
installed. On arrival the shower had recently been used and the door was wide open with the unit running that will
dispel moist air into the bedroom. On test the unit was underperforming (see ventilation section).
Atmospheric calculations herein confirmed a “moist” occupancy suggesting inadequate ventilation with condensation
observed in the thermal survey also indicating conditions at wall surfaces were such mould can be sustained.
Observations confirmed mould on uPVC windows, walls, and ceiling surfaces and is the authors concluding opinion
will be associated with periods of elevated humidity and a general lack of adequate ventilation supported by a lack of
passive ventilation, closed windows and doors left open to the wet room. Elevated wall readings are likely due to periods
of condensation which is a contributory factor to the mould growth. However, invasive Gravimetric analysis below
indicates an element of free moisture such that, with no evidence of any external issues associated with survey point 6,
this free moisture could relate to an internal leak and is recommended all plumbing is checked.

Technical Structural Health Survey Report",3
0257_TA6.pdf,"The areas of walls that showed the highest indications of moisture present within the wall or on the
surface were in the kitchen and bathroom (see table at 6.4 below). I did not view the property prior to
the remedial mould treatment work being carried out by the landlord, however I have seen pictures
taken of the surface mould in April 2015, prior to the remediation work being carried out and refer to
these pictures in my assessment of the underlying causes for mould on the internal walls.
Considering the property as a whole and the distribution of mould in relation to areas of actual
dampness found in the structure I am of the opinion that there are two primary factors at work creating
atmospheric conditions for moisture in the atmosphere to condense onto the internal walls of the
structure where the temperature is at or below dew point.
The pictures taken in April 2015 clearly show that there have been very high levels of occupational
moisture generated by the tenant inside the building. These are principally from the tumble drier,
cooking and bathing. This moisture has in my opinion not been extracted satisfactorily from the
property at the time and point of generation because:
 The tumble drier vents straight into the kitchen and there is no kitchen door to isolate this room
from others within the property.
 There is no extraction fan in the kitchen to extract occupational moisture generated from the
tumble drier, boiling water, washing up, cooking etc.
 The bathroom extraction fan is not functioning and in any event looks quite old and if working
might not be sufficient for satisfactory extraction. (On the day of survey the fan isolator found to
be in the off position)
Moisture levels within the property are being exacerbated by damp walls in the kitchen due to a lack of
an effective DPC or DPM under the kitchen floor and walls. The use of a room venting tumble drier
would have the effect of locally raising the temperature and absorbing moisture from the damp wall,
particularly at the end of a drying cycle when the clothes are dry, but warm dry air is being exhausted by
the machine. Drying walls out in this way will accelerate the uptake of moisture into the atmosphere,
raising the temperature allows more moisture to be absorbed in the form of vapour which then
transfers to colder parts of the building where it will condense from vapour to water on the parts of the
structure that are at or below dew point.
If the living compartment surfaces are above Dew Point, especially when heating is on, then the vapour
will be absorbed into the structure where, when it meets a colder part, it will condense out into water as
interstitial condensation or in the loft void as surface condensation either into the upper levels of the
insulation where it meets cooler air or on the underfelt.
Atmospheric moisture readings taken in the loft, even with the PPU running showed that there was 15%
more moisture in the air when compared with external air and 12.5% when compared with the living
compartment. I am of the pinion that the PPU will be detrimental to this structure as it has been
installed in the loft which clearly has very little ventilation to the outside air (4% of that required under
current building regulations). Even if this loft was properly ventilated I doubt that the use of such a unit
will have an overall positive benefit
I would expect that at times when the bathroom and particularly the shower are in use, the moisture
load in the loft would be substantially higher especially since it is just re-circulating vapour already
absorbed through the ceiling, back down into the living compartment. Thus increasing the amount of
moisture below the ceiling.
I noted that the front bedroom door had been removed. This might also create a cycling of moisture
during times of sleep, which are also the same periods when loft spaces are coldest and more likely to
have moisture vapour condensing out on the surface. The net effect of a PPU could be akin to creating a
moisture battery for the property.
Thermal imaging below clearly shows that there is a cold margin at the tops of the walls that is probably
caused by poor installation of the cavity wall insulation (CWI) or slumping post installation. I am also of
the opinion that the loft insulation has not been installed in a very neat and tidy fashion whereby it is in
full contact with the ceiling, particularly at the edges. I noted that trays to prevent insulation from
blocking air flow at the wall plate have been removed in places. Notwithstanding these would have in
fact been of little use as no verge or soffit cross flow ventilation has been installed.
The pictures taken in April 2015 clearly show black mould which is most likely to have been caused by
the condensation of occupational moisture which in turn is increased by the use of the tumble drier
internally force drying the structure in the immediate vicinity and passing this moist air through the
building to colder parts of the structure especially as they cannot be isolated with doors.
I noted that the rendering to the building has largely detached from background. This is typical of
buildings of this age that were rendered using a lime rendering. The walls were also given a decorative
pebble dash coat which has been painted with numerous coats of PVA based paint, thereby making the
walls impermeable to moisture vapour which as it leaches out of the building, will condense and build
up further in the structure and especially in the CWI where it is likely to be at or below dew point much
of the time. Detached render can also attract and hold external moisture particularly in areas where the
render is breached or damaged.
The transference of moisture in this manner is not in itself unusual and in an unpainted or appropriately
painted building; this would normally evaporate to atmosphere during the dryer months of the year.
However in this building it is not evaporating and interstitial condensation will increase until the CWI
and walls are saturated and I have come across many similar properties where this is the case. All
generally are a similar age and construction to this property where retrofit systems, removal of
chimneys, poor cavity wall insulation, non breathable paint systems, to name just a few; have combined
with excessive occupational moisture to create a non breathable building that is highly prone to
interstitial condensation that cannot evaporate.
Please find attached a scan of a condensation risk analysis for the external walls of this property. I would
point out that I have used a 0.2 mm polyester film to simulate the non breathable PVA paint system.
This clearly shows that interstitial condensation will not adequately dry out of the property, carrying
moisture over to the next winter period where, with a reduced thermal performance, matters will just
get worse. Please note that missing page numbers are blank pages not scanned to save waste.",1

Scope
Following instructions from ……………………. we have attended site to carry out an investigation into
reports of damp and condensation within the property.
Report
1.0 Property: a three-bedroom mid-terraced house built
on two floors. A Pitched roof of clay double Roman tiles.
External walls front and rear are one brick thick in English
garden wall bond.
A bedroom has been formed in the loft area many years
ago, but this is no longer in use, but is used for storage.
The original sash windows have been replaced with
double glazed UPVC windows. All external doors have
been replaced with UPVC frames and doors. An extension
housing the kitchen and bathroom has been constructed
to the rear of the building.
2.0 Incident:
I am advised by Mrs Clapp that she and her family have lived here since 2006. They first noticed
problems within a short time of occupying the building, but did not report this until 2009. The first
problem they noticed was damp in the corner of the lounge then this started to appear in bedroom 3 on
the other side of the building and this then spread to bedroom three 2. She feels the problem has got
worse over the years and now they feel they are suffering with damp and condensation throughout the
building. Mrs Clapp stated that the landlords have carried out some work during their occupancy to
alleviate the problem and since they have complained they have had a number of visits from surveyors
to look at this. However to date they do not feel the problem has been sorted. These works
encompassed a new boiler, fascia boards and soffits, gutters and downpipes. In 2014 the landlords
carried out some works on the roof. Mrs Clapp stated that she believes this was replacing roofing felt to
the kitchen extension.
3.0 Disrepair Items.
I did not notice any areas or points of disrepair however the state of the rear external brickwork walls
could be improved substantially with repointing using a lime mortar or rendering the walls using a lime
render and vapour permeable coloured paint such as Carbolastic or similar.(see attached data sheets).
Ideally this wall should be insulated externally and a thin coat vapour permeable finish similar to K Rend.
The front walls were well bedded with lime mortar and in my opinion in good condition for the age of
the property. This could also be insulated using a thin coat vapour permeable system. Please note that
insulating both front and rear to the building would require moving the fascia boards to the outside line
of insulation and increasing the overhang on the roof. However the roof does require substantial
maintenance and ventilation, therefore this would be an ideal opportunity to fully insulate re--roof and
ventilate this property up to a high standard.
I did not carry out a roof inspection but I would suspect that the condition of the roof to the main house
is generally very poor. The underfelt that has been used beneath the double Roman tiles is a reinforced
plastic sheet type. This is not vapour permeable/breathable. Some mushroom vents have been installed
in the roof, 3 in the rear and 2 in the front. These would only provide a fraction of the ventilation
required under current the building regulations minimum requirements. Current regulation would also
require that the felt used is of a breathable type. I could not see any evidence of over the fascia or soffit
ventilation front or rear of the building and would therefore recommend that this building be roofed to
current building regulation standards and that the loft area is also insulated properly. It should be noted
that the insulation will be required be placed within the existing rafters if the loft extension room is to
be retained. However the condition of this room is extremely poor as I doubt that this work was carried
out correctly at the time of installation.
4.0 Conclusion and Summary
Mrs Clapp stated that she has not actually had visible moisture on the walls, however she has had areas
of mould and this was visible on the walls both front and rear of the building. She reports that the
problem appears to be worse in winter and is accompanied by a damp smell.
My investigations did not reveal any areas visible moisture on the surface at any point throughout the
building including in bedroom 3 cupboard where there was a substantial amount of mould and
efflorescence on the surface of the wallpaper. It was also interesting to note that whilst this wall
appeared to be very wet it was in fact dry REL readings in the wall inside this cupboard were typically
187 with a WME of 11%.
The mould prevalent in this property appears to be the common black mould Cladosporium Herbarum.
It is a very common fungal plant pathogen and is often found in occupied properties that have poor
ventilation and subsequent high atmospheric moisture levels that give rise to condensation on those
parts of the internal structure that are at or below dew point temperature for the relative humidity that
exists in the building.
Throughout the building at low-level or high readings moisture within the structure of the wall under
the plaster, but the surface was dry. This is indicative of a building that has had a silicon injection damp
proof course and the lower 1 m from the floor of the walls plastered using sand and cement backing
coat and an anti-salt additive.
Further evidence of this shows in the bottom sections of the stair string particularly on the right-hand
side as you go up where a WME reading of 48% was recorded. This is indicative again of rising damp in
internal walls and an area where was probably impossible for the damp proofing company to remove
the stairs. Further investigation should be carried out in this area to ensure that no dry or wet rot has set
in to the building from this point as it is likely to spread and infect the rest of the building. I was not
aware of the smell of any rot however the building was well ventilated when I arrived with windows
open to all rooms. The floor to the front dining room is a suspended floor. Ventilation to this section the
floor is inadequate and as the walls are damp due to no DPC and the walls it is likely that moisture will
have migrated into the timbers. Whilst buildings of this age tended to have good quality resinous
timbers used for floor joists that are less vulnerable to rot, it is of course an area that should be
monitored. Therefore recommend if the opportunity arises this be looked at in due course.
The internal wall of the dining room on the front elevation together with the party wall and chimney
breast has been dry lined. I was unable to ascertain if this included any insulation. Dry lining will not give
any indicative REL readings and WME readings showed that this was typically dry at all levels.
All chimneys in the property have been sealed off and vents have been provided at the lower levels. The
upper levels appear to have open chimney pots, I would therefore recommend that these have saddle
tops or rain cowls fitted as a precaution against rain driving down into the chimney flues.
The internal atmospheric conditions recorded at 6.3 below were taken after closing the windows for one
hour these indicate that there is some moisture entering the atmosphere internally in the building,
particularly in bedroom 1. I would suggest that this is possibly coming through the solid masonry walls
which are gradually drying out. As well as a small amount in the lower levels where there is no DPC. I do
not believe that this is moisture coming from the kitchen and bathroom areas as these are both located
in a rear extension. The kitchen has reasonable ventilation of 46 L/sec and the bathroom 7.8 L/sec.
whilst neither of these conforms to building regulations the fact that they are extracting and that they
are located in the rear extension would suggest that they are not the source of the moisture entering
the atmosphere in the rest of the building. Notwithstanding the mechanical ventilation systems need to
be improved up to current building regulations standards and in particular the bathroom which only has
an overrun of 3 minutes instead of the required 15 minutes.
The loft avoid appears to have been constructed as a bedroom at one point in time. However currently
the present tenants do not use this as there is no adequate staircase. It is however used for general
household storage. Parts of this structure are collapsing and could be considered to be unsafe. The roof
is clearly unventilated and there is evidence of mould in the upper surfaces of the fibreglass insulation
which would suggest that moisture vapour is rising up into the cold unventilated roof void and
condensing. The roof void requires ventilating to current building regulation standards. Whilst there are
mushroom vents front and rear these are completely inadequate and coupled with the fact the under
felt is completely vapour impermeable this is a breeding ground for moisture when the atmospheric
temperature drops below due point.
In summary I am of the opinion that this building suffers from condensation particularly to the external
walls which are solid masonry and uninsulated. This as a result of moisture entering the atmosphere
through the cold walls as well as from general occupancy. The tenants have a condensing tumble dryer.
It is approximately two years old however I am of the opinion that this type of dryer can be a cause of
increases in atmospheric moisture. The location of this tumble dryer is immediately next to the entrance
to the kitchen where there is no doorway. Whilst the tenants are aware that this has to be cleaned on a
regular basis it is possible that it is a likely source of some of the atmospheric moisture contributed to
the building by the tenants. I would recommend when the tumble dryer is used that the kitchen is
sealed off from the rest of the house. A door should be fitted in the existing frame between the kitchen
and lounge. Likewise I recommend that a door is fitted between the lounge and the hallway as this
would help prevent moisture going into the upper rooms.
Moisture levels in the rear walls are well above that to be expected in a building that could be
considered dry. I therefore feel that if any works are carried out to the external walls these should most
definitely be the rear walls and the return reveal on the neighbouring property. I would always
recommend where possible that you use external wall insulation with thin coat render as this retains the
thermal mass within the building whilst at the same time keeping the dew point as near the outer part
of the wall as possible and if sufficient insulation is used the dew point is more likely to be within the
closed cell insulation and therefore interstitial condensation will not become a problem.
5.0 Recommendations:
1) Repair defective brickwork and render the rear solid wall and return reveal with lime render and
finish with a breathable vapour permeable paint. Alternatively insulate the walls externally and
apply a thin coat render system similar to K Rend.
2) Re-roof the property and provide adequate ventilation to the roof void in accordance with
current building regulations.
3) Install saddle tops or rain cowls to all chimney pots.
4) Carry out an inspection of floor joists for signs of any wet or dry rot.
5) Improve ventilation to kitchen and bathroom up to current bill direct regulation standards of 60
L/sec in the kitchen and 15 L/sec in the bathroom. The bathroom fan ideally should be a
humidistat controlled fan with a minimum of 15 minutes overrun after its start-up period.
6) Fit doors to the kitchen/lounge and lounge/hall and keep these shut during cooking and using
the tumble dryer washing et cetera.
7) Thorough Professional Mould remediation work utilizing a Biocide, should be undertaken
throughout the property, particularly in bedrooms 2 and 3 as well as on the internal front wall in
the mould but will not kill the root system of mould.
8) The insulation in the roof void is contaminated with mould. This should be disposed of to tip, the
area treated with biocide and new insulation put down to prevent further infection of the
property.
6.0 Moisture Survey and Floor Plan
6.1 Occupation:
4 adults 1 dog (small). Daily showers each adult some drying of washings within the house. Condensing
tumble drier.
6.2 Ventilation:
Bathroom 100 mm diameter fan airflow 1 m/s. This requires a new fan, preferably one with a humidistat
control. The ducting also requires to be cleaned out.
Kitchen 150 mm diameter fan airflow 2.6 m/s. ideally this should be improved and preferably ventilation
provided above the cooker.
Note:
There are open doorways between the kitchen and lounge as well as lounge and hallway. The removal
of doors is not conducive to keeping moisture away from the main living compartment and will
contribute to occupational moisture. Compartmentalisation in buildings is important for control of
moisture as well as fires, sound, pets, etc.

7.0 Structural problems and Photographs
7.1 RHS of back door to yard from lounge. There is damp
within the walls at low level due to a lack of DPC,
however the Cladosporium Herbarum mould seen on the
wall is caused by condensation on the surface as a result
of this being a cold uninsulated solid wall.
7.2 Bedroom 3 Unusable Cupboard
The mould in this cupboard is Cladosporium Herbarum
but other mould pathogens may be present. The whole
area should be scraped off and cleaned with a biocide.
7.3 Low level in cupboard above.
7.4 Behind the bed in bedroom 3.
7.5 Rear bedroom 2 wall.
7.6 Rear wall in bedroom 2 above.
7.7 Note the lack of cowl to prevent rain ingress into
redundant flues.
7.8 The condition of the pointing and brickwork is very
poor. This has been mainly due to inappropriate pointing
with sand and cement and resulting frost damage. This
wall would ideally suit external insulation with thin coat
silicate rendering (K Rend or similar) ensuring that it is
vapour permeable.
7.9 The front wall brickwork is sound. However, if this is
insulated I would recommend that it be carried out on
the external elevation so as to avoid a situation where
the dew point ends up behind internal insulation, causing
interstitial condensation to build up internally.
7.10 The underfloor ventilation to the front dining room
is unlikely to be sufficient.
7.11 The loft area conversion is in a poor state of repair.
7.12 The underfelt to the roof is vapour impermeable and
there is insufficient ventilation to the roof void.
7.13 The insulation in the roof void is contaminated with
black mould. This should be disposed to tip and the area
treated with biocide. New insulation should put down to
prevent further infection of the property only after it has
been ventilated and re-roofed.
7.14 The 3 mushroom vents to the rear roof and 2 to the
front roof are insufficient to adequately ventilate the roof
void. There are no other signs of ventilation to this roof
void.
I confirm that my report includes all of the facts which I regard as being relevant to the opinions which I
have expressed.

Survey Equipment used.
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
A Protimeter Aquant BLD5760 moisture detector, using radio frequency survey method, giving readings
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. This gives readings for moisture in materials up to a depth of 19 mm
depending on material characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for
interpretation, therefore they should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
A Protimeter Mini BLD2000 using electrical impedance survey method on wood and other non
conductive materials. On wood it measures moisture content from 6% to 28%, the level at which the
fibres are saturated. In other non conductive materials the instrument measures the WME (Wood
Moisture Equivalent) up to 28%.
The WME value is a theoretical moisture level that would be attained by wood that is in moisture
equilibrium with the material being tested. The full measurement range is from 6 to 90 but values over
Readings at depths from surface readings up to 25 mm (Using a hammer probe) can be taken.

0072_RH10.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised of concerns mainly to areas of the skirting through a number of rooms
and, a visual inspection confirmed the presence of such to skirting surfaces fitted to both internal and
external walls.
A moisture profile conducted through the property as a whole confirmed elevated moisture readings to
all lower walls and some skirtings with it also confirmed to be the same in the adjoining communal hallway
with a dehumidifier noted to be operating that alone will only control the atmosphere.
It is likely the residual issue could align to construction bound moisture throughout the properties with
the pattern only suggesting low level high readings. This property was very well ventilated at the time
and, the installed extractor devices were checked for their performance suggesting the issue is not likely
to be condensation related.
It is the opinion of the author the localized issues relate to damp skirting and lower walls that, following
recent occupation has developed into areas of mould growth.
As mould is a symptom of a problem, itis likely the structure will require some drying to evaporate the
residual construction moisture down to acceptable levels.
To aid this, the removal of all skirtings through the property and holes drilled into the gaps left in the walls
to minimize cosmetic damage, will aid the evaporation process.
And, depending upon the disruption to current occupants, consideration can be given to injecting dry
processed air into the walls through the holes with some left open to expel the moist air for it to either
be captured by a deployed dehumidifier or, allowed to vacate the property vis open windows and working
extractors.
Of note, evaporation is the key process and, air movement is a significant mechanism in the process for
encouraging further timely evaporation via capillary action. In the absence of such equipment, the
structure will indeed dry but will likely take a longer period to conclude what would then be a ‘natural’
process.",1
0141_E7.pdf,"We understand that one adult and two infants reside at the flat with the adult currently working.
We are advised there are 2 - 3 washing loads processed per week and dried within the flat with the aid
of a clothes horse or on occasions at the local laundrette.
The uPVC windows all have trickle vents, some of which were open at the time of the survey. Also noted
were a number of the curtains being drawn.
In the kitchen a 125mm diameter extraction unit operates via a switch with no overrun. On test the unit
produced a flow rate of 2.2 m/s which equates to 27 l/s and is close to the current recommended flow
rate for an extractor unit if located adjacent a hob but not if located elsewhere. It was noted the flutes
to the unit were only opening half way when running and the unit itself is in poor condition and needs
cleaning.
A 100mm diameter extraction unit in the bathroom operates via a pull cord to the light switch and on
test, the unit produced a flow rate of 1.0 m/s with an overrun of 2-3 mins and appeared to be in good
condition. The flow rate however is below the current recommended flow rate of 2 m/s (15 l/s) for a
bathroom and a 15 minute overrun.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out and in the main the structure was dry. A high surface
moisture level was however recorded at base level in the bedroom at survey location point B where
mould has developed (see Section 6.2 & 7.4). A drilled reading recorded at approx. 20mm deep at
location point B was confirmed dry at 8.9% WME indicating likely condensation as the cause.
At the time of our survey, mould was also noted to the top of the external wall in the kitchen located
near the extraction unit, on a section of the external wall in the lounge and around the window in the
bathroom. Condensation was noted to the same window.
It is the opinion of the author the mould outbreaks are likely due to a lack of adequate ventilation in
areas of the property and prevailing atmospheric conditions driven in the main from the build-up of cold
exterior walls with the amount of contents currently placed against them and the drying of clothes
within the flat adding to the internal moisture load. The presence of mould on contents is indicative of
elevated atmospheric humidity in the property.
The atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey under protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002
‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation being classified
as ‘moist’ (see section 5.5).
At the time of our survey thermal imaging (see section 6.0) revealed condensation was an issue at some
locations in the property.",3
0179_N19.pdf,"3.1: A moisture survey found the property to be generally in a dry state with slightly raised moisture
levels in the plaster skim at the bottom of the wall adjoining the galleried lounge area external door. The
levels found may be indicative of condensation forming on the wall as opposed to penetrating moisture
migrating past the window frame seal.
3.2: It appears that ‘Cold Bridging’ is occurring along the perimeter of the metal window frames. At the
time of our survey the conditions were not found but evidence exists where mould is forming around
areas where brackets are located. Cold bridging allows low external temperatures to migrate into the
living space causing material temperatures to drop below dew point. When condensation occurs this
allows naturally occurring mould spores to grow.
3.3: The small bedroom is built off an existing wall. It appears the top section, approximately 1m, is a
new construction. It was not possible to confirm the construction method utilised in this wall. If the wall
has been built without any form of cavity or insulation there is a possibility cold bridging will occur
across the wall which may lead to condensation forming. High moisture levels at depth were found using
a non-invasive meter to the right of the window on rear elevation. The property appears to have a
plaster skim over a hard render substrate which is less porous than gypsum plaster. There is no evidence
of moisture on the internal materials.
3.4: There are three small water stain spots on the ceiling above the galleried lounge area and a larger
mark which has appeared recently on the ceiling above the kitchen area. These may be due to ingress of
water through the roof structure, or may be due to condensation forming on the underside of the
profile metal sheeting and finding a drip point such as a roof screw or purling.
3.5: The open plan nature of the property and the high ceilings above the galleried lounge area lends
itself to moist hot air rising up to the front 1st floor windows. There is evidence of moisture damage to
condensation forming on the metal surfaces. It was not possible to assess the insulation across this area
at the time of our survey.
3.6: There is no sheet ‘fiberglass’ insulation installed over the plasterboard ceiling or along the vertical
stud walls in the loft area above the main living areas. This will result in heat loss into the void which will
help raise the temperature within the void thus minimising the opportunity for materials to drop below
dew point temperature.",1
0117_CM18.pdf,"High moisture readings were recorded to the floor and walls in the bathroom and the connecting wall to
the bedroom. There is likely to be contributing factors to the raised moisture levels noted in the
bathroom being the numerous leaks which we are advised have been fixed.
To conclude the bathroom wall and floor requires drying and to assist the regime, the flooring/ wall
coverings along with WC, basin and bath should be removed to achieve the desired drying goal. On
doing so, there could be elements of blown plaster which will also need to be removed.
Resultant moisture within the structure could be resulting in condensation within the flat leading to the
likely cause of the mould noted.
At time of survey, thermal images were taken which concluded that condensation was either occurring
or, likely to occur in both of the affected rooms. Mould was also present in both rooms on the external
walls and sections of ceilings.
During the survey it was observed a brick had previously been removed on the external wall in the
bedroom between points G and H from the inside and, although it revealed parts of the cavity appeared
blocked with rubble and localized root growth, there were no elevated readings in the property in these
areas.
Although not related to the survey of the wall to the bedroom and bathroom, at the time of the survey,
most of the windows and trickle vents were closed and the tenant advises that mould has always been
an issue within the flat especially in the colder months.",1
0080_SO19.pdf,"Due to the volume of contents in front of both internal and external walls, a limited non-invasive moisture
profile was completed throughout the flat which confirmed a dry structure.
Regarding existing ventilation measures, there are working mechanical extraction units in both the kitchen
and bathroom, a passive vent in bedroom 1 and a PIV unit and trickle vents to all windows other than in
the lounge.
Observations revealed some outbreaks of mould development within the bathroom with the tenant
advising they recently cleaned the surfaces, which is undertaken on a regular basis. In addition, it was
apparent a large volume of contents were evident in front of wall surfaces which has allowed colder areas
to develop (see section 5.0).
As part of the ventilation and moisture profiling, in accordance with BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for
control of condensation in buildings: Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied
buildings, a ‘wet’ occupancy was determined (section 4.4.1).
In conclusion it is the author’s opinion, based upon a dry structure and observations made including a
review of the thermal survey images, the concerns raised by the tenant are likely to be attributed to: -
 A general lack of adequate cross ventilation throughout the property.
 The volume of contents in front of wall surfaces which will exacerbate condensation and mould
potential driven by the aforementioned lack of adequate ventilation.",3
0081_SO31.pdf,"Upon arrival Mr & Mrs Correla were in attendance alongside 3 medium sized dogs which can readily align
to the effectiveness of ventilation measures due to the internal atmospheric moisture being generated.
A moisture profile conducted through the property as a whole confirmed a dry construction however, in
areas of suggested elevated readings, they are sporadic and each can have a likely reason. In the bathroom
a high low level reading could align to an issue in the cavity wall with potential wet insulation and could
similarly be the case by the kitchen door. In the kitchen cupboard a wet wall reading could align to recent
repairs appearing to the mortar and brickwork close the window and is taking its time to dry naturally. In
the lounge, the window reveal being an area of staining is a concern to the residents and a check across
the elevation suggested raised readings when close to the window only. From an external perspective,
this could likely align to a visible gap between the concrete plinth and the uPVC window beneath it. Suffice
to add, the resident showed the author an image taken after rainfall whereby their plinth remained wet
at the base above the window and the same construction next door was dry.
In addition, at low level around the circumference of the property a concrete skirt was noted that may be
breaching the installed DPC. This can, with cavity wall insulation (CWI) lead to damp bridging across the
cavity and is recommended this is checked and confirmed by respective experts.
There was no evidence of mould development at the time of the survey and, an assessment of installed
ventilation measures was undertaken to determine the ‘adequacy’ of their intention. In the bathroom a
forced extraction unit runs continuously with a boost function aligned to relative humidity levels which
was not determined at the time.
In the kitchen a similar unit runs continuously with a pull cord boost function with the resident also
advising it has a relative humidity function setting not checked at the time.
Both units operate below the current recommendations specified in Part F of the Building Regs and ideally
should be assessed for flow rate compliance. Passive trickle vents were observed and could be regarded
as sufficient for this aspect.
To the exterior of the kitchen extractor, it was noted to vent through a passive wall plate which was also
partly blocked by clear silicone. A borescope did not confirm the presence of any ducting and can align to
warm moist air being vented into the cavity as well as the exterior to a degree. It is recommended this is
inspected and resolved so as not to impair the suggested cavity wall insulation (CWI) polystyrene beads.
In both bedrooms a large passive wall plate was noted that in the opinion of the author will have an
adverse effect on the localized internal environment and, can serve to locally cool the structure where
they are installed leading to significant surface temperature differences and a likely location for mould
due to periods of condensation. With open trickle vents observed, these additional passive devices will
likely increase the coolness of their room locations.
To the exterior we understand there have been repairs conducted to areas of pointing with additional
passive plates also sealed with clear silicone evident.
However, even with any defects noted to the exterior finish, rainwater would still have to find its way to
the inner leaf to cause internal issues and, in this case could use installed CWI as a ‘bridge’. And, potential
bridging of the DPC could also contribute to this issue.",1
0265_TA8.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.2) indicated in general that with exception to the reported areas in the
bedrooms the first floor displayed dry readings. The ground floor also is generally dry with areas of
interest around the back door and under the combination boiler in the dining area. At the time of the
survey based on BS 5250:2002 (Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings) the occupation
would be considered to be ‘dry’ (Section 4.5).
The reported damp patch to the chimney stack wall in bedroom 2 was not evident as the wallpaper had
recently been removed. However, the damp patches to the ceilings of bedrooms 2 and 3 were clearly
evident through the Artex (Sections 6.1 and 6.2), with moisture survey of the walls and ceiling (Sections",1
0191_PL25.pdf,"It is my opinion that the roof construction of this property was not carried out in the correct
manner and in accordance with building regulations at the time of construction. The eaves
ventilation has been compromised by the guttering being fitted to the underside of the Redland
Stonewold concrete tiles restricting the slot vents that have been fitted. The roofing felt has been
allowed to drape into the gutter where it is getting extremely wet and wicking moisture up into
the edge of the roof. I am of the opinion that as this is defective it is highly likely that the same
trades formed the verges incorrectly compromising the ventilation to either side of the property.
This is further borne out by the fact that I was unable to feel any air flow on either side of the
property inside the loft.
The loft insulation is heavily contaminated with mould in the surface, as can be seen from
pictures below. This should be removed to tip and the entire loft cleaned and fogged with a
suitable biocide to kill any mould spores or mould root systems.
Moisture build up in the loft void as result of the inadequate eaves cross flow ventilation has
been further exacerbated by moisture getting into the loft void where the stack pipe has not been
adequately joined to the mushroom vent. There is also a severely restricted bathroom flexible
duct that takes a tortuous route around the building to get to a mushroom vent. This is some
considerable distance away from the bathroom. I carried out a test to the bathroom fan and could
not detect any extraction airflow when the fan was operating. This confirmed that the pipe was a
totally restricted.
I installed a solo D remote monitoring unit in the loft and monitored this during the 3.5 weeks
after survey.",1
0115_CH7.pdf,"No evidence of penetrating damp breaching the wall construction was noted at the time of the survey.
All wall areas measured below 250 REL whereby readings below 250 REL are considered to be dry.
There was also no evidence of rising damp breaching the DPC system at the time of the investigation.
The location and pattern of mould growth tends to indicate high humidity and a likely lack of air
circulation across the affected areas as the main factor in the formation of the mould.
At the time of the survey the duct extracting moist air from the over-hob extractor was found to be
disconnected (see Sections 6.1 and 6.3.1). This will likely result in moisture laden air being circulated
into the kitchen and adjoining hallway and lounge areas resulting in suitable conditions for naturally
occurring mould spores to activate.",1
0227_SO51.pdf,"The survey covers four main areas of concern through the property which are displaying moisture
related issues.",0
0226_SO51.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant moisture levels across many of wall structures
through the property with both the ground floor and first floor affected. Observations indicated
previous damp remedial works have been undertaken and a number of the wall structures have been
plasterboard dry lined plus wood paneling having been installed in a number of areas.
The main areas of concern are highlighted on the floor plans plus the recorded levels are detailed in the
moisture survey. Raised moisture levels were indicated in areas where dry lining and wood paneling has
been installed in general affecting the base of the wall structures. It is the opinion of the author in these
areas moisture from the structure is migrating into the internal wall structures.
With regard to the ground floor, in a number of areas moisture was noted affecting the lower part of the
wall structures and is likely to be ground related moisture affecting the structure. In a number of areas
significant moisture levels were noted extending from the ground floor up the wall structures to the first
floor.
The moisture in these, as well as other areas affected to the first floor are likely to be caused by
rainwater getting behind the external render finishes and migrating to the internal surfaces. The
external decoration appears to be in very good order and is the opinion of the author the exterior has
recently been decorated and may well have covered cracking to the render finishes. Damp wall
structures during the winter months will be considerably cooler than dry walls and can also drive
condensation issues in the property.
A review of the ceilings through the property indicated dry conditions plus a visual review of the exterior
suggested the roof was in good order.",1

Scope
Following instruction from …………………., attend the above property to report on current structural damp
and mould conditions with regard to weather ingress associated with parapet walls etc.
Report
1.0 Property:
The surveyed property is a single storey extension to a
land manor house. The extension is reported to date from
the 1980’s of cavity wall construction with a flat roof.
2.0 Incident:
Weather ingress is reported to have affected a number of
areas throughout the single storey extension and
reported to be associated with the parapet wall detail
around the exterior of the loss affected area.
3.0 Conclusions:
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) in general displayed dry readings with regard to the ceiling structures
throughout the surveyed areas. However, slightly raised levels were indicated with regard to the ceiling
in the loss affected area to the kitchen at survey location 18.
With regard to the wall structures, significant moisture levels were indicated in a number of areas with
high levels extending down the affected walls from the ceiling. With regard to the dining area high
readings were noted to the base of the walls extending up as detailed in the moisture survey.
The atmospheric levels recorded (See section 4.1) showed clearly the internal moisture conditions are
being driven by external conditions.
The thermal survey showed condensation was a consideration across the North facing elevation to the
surveyed property and certainly in areas where damp wall structures were indicated.

0184_NW10.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was undertaken which highlighted some areas of raised moisture (see
Sections 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5) and include areas to the base of the external wall in the kitchen (Survey point
W) the likely cause of which appears to relate to rainwater discharging down the outside of the
downpipe which a visual inspection suggests has been a long term issue (see Section 6.4). Also noted
was an element of poor pointing to the brick work in this area.
In addition, raised moisture levels were also noted around the bay window in Bedroom 1 at the front of
the property up to a height consistent with being just below the level of the window.
A section of floorboard to the base of the same external wall bay has also dropped suggesting it may be
rotten. Localised elevated moisture readings were also recorded to the floors directly below the skirting
board line at survey points 10, 12, 13 and 15.
The raised moisture levels are likely due to either the localised defects noted and a possible lack of
natural ventilation within the subfloor especially considering a number of air bricks appear blocked and
others partially blocked at ground level potentially allowing rain water to enter the void. It is further
likely that condensation/humidity could be a supporting issue and could relate to the reported rodents
which we are advised is currently being dealt with.",1
0112_CA1.pdf,"During the thermographic survey of an exterior cavity wall the Technician noted the wall in question was
currently undergoing injection drying at a low level. The said wall which is on either side of the chimney
breast is being injection dried by means of a 150 desiccant dehumidifier injecting through 6 points (3
either side of the chimney breast). There are however no exhaust ports to enable the moisture laden air
to escape the cavity and this wall is the only one to have undergone plaster removal to a height of
400mm with no works being carried out to the remaining walls in the room. It wasn’t clear if the
desiccant was exhausting to the exterior during the survey.
It has also been noted that no air flow was being directed to the floor void in order to reduce excess
atmospheric conditions and the expected levels of Moisture Content (%MC) in the timbers.
During the survey thermal images were taken and no particular cold spots have been identified other
than at floor level and is likely due to cold air travelling up from the floor void. The cavity was inspected
using an endoscope and the insulation identified as injection fibre type.
Moisture readings were taken of the affected areas and found to be within acceptable levels with the
exception of sporadic areas of the walls that were not being treated. These readings were only slightly
elevated and at low level only.
The property was found to have undergone a chemical injection treatment, however the tenant
indicated they had lived in the property for 30 years and these works had been carried out prior to them
moving in. The injection treatment was found to have been injected into the brick and not the mortar.
Because of the length of time since the treatment had been carried out it is the author’s opinion that
the treatment would possibly be ineffective now.
It is the authors opinion with regard to the thermal survey of the wall there are no associated cold spots
found at the time of survey.",1
0185_NW11.pdf,"During the survey it was noted that on entering the property the conditions appeared to feel humid and
very warm. The tenant proceeded to show us areas of concern by the way of, what appeared to be,
water staining to low level walls within the bedroom.
A full damp survey was carried out together with atmospheric readings to each room and invasive
inspection with the described areas (see Section 4.0).
It was noted the property does not have trickle vents fitted to any of the window but does benefit from
a positive air input system which introduces air through a vent system and is extracted via an extraction
system, with the moisture from the expelled air discharged through a drip tube after passing through
carbon filters. When measuring the air speed of the unit is was noted the input was producing air at
1.4m/s and extraction at 0.5m/s.
A section of brick work to the exterior within the area of concern was removed which exposed the cavity
and Celotex insulation. This revealed the cavity to be blocked with debris thought to be from when the
property was constructed. In addition the brick ties going from the external face to the internal wall
were found to be saturated and causing the area of contact through the insulation to be wet.
Deep probes were inserted into the insulation to ascertain whether it was wet, readings indicated it was.
It was also noted the surrounding garden area is of clay base and the ground slopes steeply towards the
property.
The tenant advised when they moved into the property, there was severe mould contamination to all
areas. It was indicated no effective mould remediation was undertaken suggesting the root of the mould
to have been left in a dormant state, returning as soon as the conditions became suitable.
An external inspection revealed a down pipe and waste drainage at the point of concern with a separate
drain rodding eye. No damage was noted at the time of the survey.
Free standing wardrobes that had been removed from the property and placed in a weather proof
exterior building were inspected having been advised they had stood within the master bedroom on an
internal wall. The wardrobes had several mould contamination to the interior which would indicate a
condensation issues, however we acknowledge at the time of the survey there were in an exterior
building which was clean and dry.
We noted laundry is dried using a condensing tumbledryer vented via the utility room window. It is
assumed during cold months the window is closed.
In conclusion, it would appear bridging within the cavity is causing moisture ingress to the walls. In
addition the imbalance of the positive input ventilation system is allowing condensation to form.
It would be advisable to carry out effective mould remediation to affected areas to kill the root.",1
0234_SS5.pdf,"During the period of monitoring, 27th January – 17th February 2015, condensation formed on the roof
membrane fairly regularly depending on temperature and humidity conditions.
It is expected that condensation will form on membranes and as such they are manufactured and
installed with this in mind.
The area of bedroom ceiling affected is directly below the soil pipe vent. The pipe passes through the
membrane which is cut with a 30mm clearance. When high levels of moisture form it will start to run
down both sides of the membrane and will drip past the cut-out onto the fibreglass below. When
membranes are cut it is good practice that it should be lipped up on the top side so that moisture will
pass any openings. This has been done where the new tile vents have been installed (see section 7.3.1).
There is evidence of poorly installed membrane above the polythene sheeting where folds and joins can
lead to moisture pooling and dripping onto the insulation and ceiling below (section 7.5.2).
Occasionally wind driven rain may be pushed past the roof tiles and enter the void between the tiles and
membrane and is the primary purpose of the membrane. The fact that the membrane appears to be
compromised in places may lead to rainwater leaking onto the insulation and ceilings below. This
process is more prevalent on roofs with a shallow pitch.
At present, following remedial works, there is no evidence of moisture affecting the ceilings below.
However there is still a plastic sheet in the loft space below which is collecting occasional moisture. At
the time of our initial visit there was some evidence of water pooling on the sheeting.
There is evidence of mould / mildew growth on the membrane and understand that this has been
treated. Mould spores will be present on all surfaces and will advance when conditions are favourable.
There is some evidence of minor mould growth present on the plasterboard fire walls. At present this is
superficial and only noticeable along the top of the wall. We presume this will have been treated when
the membrane was treated. Plasterboard provides a good food source for mould growth as it has a
paper covering. Mould spores are naturally occurring organisms that will be carried into the roof void on
air currents. At the time of our survey there was no evidence of moisture affecting the plasterboard but
this may change depending on humidity levels in the roof space. Moisture levels ranged from 11 – 16
%WME. As can be seen from the monitoring information (Section 6) we can see that the humidity was
generally above 80% RH. Some mould’s can grow without direct contact with moisture as they can take
the moisture from the air if the relative humidity is above 80 % RH as is the case here.
Moisture levels found in the timber truss work are within acceptable tolerances i.e. generally 12 – 14
%MC and will vary depending on atmospheric conditions. The intersection between the timber and
membrane has a slightly raised level of 18 %MC in places. This is due to periodic wetting of the timber
from the membrane. There is some visual evidence of minor staining to the timber but no evidence of
mould formation which indicates the brief wetting is occurring occasionally.
The lift shaft runs up into the loft space adjoining the affected apartment. Again it is segregated by a
plasterboard firewall. We were informed that the base of the shaft which is below floor level
occasionally floods. At the time of our survey water could be seen in the void and do not have any
details of the construction of the shaft. We would however expect the shaft to be water tight. Moisture
in the shaft may increase humidity which can migrate into the roof space increasing the incidence of
condensation forming. However we consider that this is not a prime factor in the incident being
investigated as the rate of evaporation will be limited to some extent by a relatively stable temperature
range in the shaft.",1
0275_TA9.pdf,"The moisture survey of the ground floor indicated a consistent level of high moisture readings at the
base of the walls throughout (See section 4.3). Invasive drilled readings recorded at depth into the wall
structure backed up the readings taken throughout the ground floor (Section 4.4).
External observations indicated the DPC level to be below the internal floor level. A limited invasive
investigation (Section 7.2) identified what appeared to be a bituminous DPC to the party wall which
correlated with the noted DPC to the exterior. Further observations suggested the indicated DPC to the
party wall was compromised.
It appears previous damp remediation works have been carried out with the installation of a liquid
applied DPM throughout the ground floor. This has been applied up the brick wall structures prior to re-
plastering (Section 7.1). The invasive survey highlighted what appears to be older wall render/plaster
finishes between the floor screed and the brick structure to the party wall and this was covered over by
the applied DPM.
The top part of the chimney has been removed and roofed over (Section 7.2). On both the ground and
first floor levels, raised moisture levels were indicated to the now redundant chimney. This could well be
residual moisture from a previous water ingress.
With reference to ventilation of the property, it was noted there is not an extractor fan installed in the
bathroom area (Section 6.2.2). The bathroom is one of the main areas for atmospheric moisture
generation in a property and current regulation requires bathrooms to be force ventilated. In general
raised atmospheric moisture levels in properties is the main driver for damp and mould related issues
affecting structures.",1
0129_CT9.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) identified moisture levels in line with expected reported works
undertaken by BWC (Section 6.5). With regard to the areas of concern i.e. the upper wall structures to
the kitchen associated with the cooker a dry structure was indicated, and in the case of the bathroom
ceiling raised readings were indicated in a number of the areas where mould activity was noted. With
regard to the bathroom ceiling it is the opinion of the author the damp noted is driven by condensation
through occupational activity and issues with the insulation to the roof structure (Section 5.1).
Significant issues were highlighted with the forced ventilation to the bathroom area, the wall mounted
fan units was shown to be ineffective (Section 6.2) ineffective ventilation will allow damp conditions to
persist allowing mould activity to develop.
The nature of the water marks noted to the upper walls associated with the cooker are indicative of
condensation forming on the walls surface, it is most likely this occurred while cooking was being carried
with possibly the cooker hood switched off.
It was noted the cooker hood discharges into the adjoining conservatory if the external doors to the
conservatory are closed and the kitchen window is open, damp air will be circulated back into the
kitchen affecting the highlighted area.
Based on the observations made and supplied information regarding the extent of the works
undertaken by BWC it is the opinion of the author the issues being experienced are not driven by the
remedial works undertaken by BWC.",1
0256_TA6.pdf,"The orientation of the building makes it very exposed on the bend in Sydenham Road. The end
of this terrace is exposed to extremes of weather from both the west and south. This makes it
particularly vulnerable to wind driven rain and therefore detailing over verges, flashing and the
like need to be good.
The property was general in reasonable condition and clearly the tenant has made efforts to keep
on top of mould issues.
There was a small amount of mould spotting on the bathroom and bedroom ceilings which is
clearly down to condensation caused by a cold bridge in the ceiling where the insulation is not in
contact with the ceiling. The condition of the insulation above can be seen in the pictures to be
poorly laid and should be tidied up.
Whilst I could not detect any immediate areas of water ingress I suspect that when the wind is
blowing strong and it is raining, then there are areas where water might leak in. Whilst this could
be tidied up in the short term, I would recommend that this roof is replaced as soon as practically
possible as it is in an exposed position and the underfelt needs renewing.",1
0067_PO8.pdf,"On arrival, the author was shown mould growth samples
that had been sited in various areas of the dwelling. Whilst mould was indeed evident in the samples, it
was advised spores are in the atmosphere all the time and, we consume them in our everyday activities.
However, it is recognised the presence of visible mould in the dwelling is of concern and the survey was
aligned to determining the presence and associated contributory measures for its growth.
Areas of water staining were also pointed out that, with dry readings recorded at the time, could likely
relate to previous ingress issues.
With this in mind, a visual inspection of the exterior revealed a number of aspects that could contribute
to potential water ingress via gaps
This opinion is derived from the following:
 Clear damage at base of the wall finishes
 It is not clear if the entire dwelling is built off the slab and, whether a DPM was installed at the
time of construction.
 It is not clear if the bitumen floor covering was introduced after previous related issues.
 It is not clear then, if the chimney breast was constructed with or without a DPC with many
houses built on horizontal grounds with no falls not usually having them around chimneys.
 The presence and condition of potential CWI needs to be confirmed
 Determining if the open chimney pots are enabling rainfall entry that may be residing in the
stack at base if it is built off the slab leading to the ingress.
From a ventilation perspective, tests were conducted of the installed extraction devices with the kitchen
unit isolated via a wall switch at the time extracting with a flow rate of 2.1 l/s and 8.6 l/s when the boost
pull cord was pulled. This device is not performing to the recommended 60 l/s required in a kitchen when
sited away from a cooker.
In the bathroom this unit was also isolated but, advised to be sporadic in its noisy operation. On test this
issue was confirmed with flow rates difficult to obtain and will need to be reviewed in order to deliver the
recommended 15 l/s for a bathroom.
Both rooms have trickle vents fitted which should be closed when an installed device is operating along
with the windows in order to clear the rooms and not draw air in and out from the exterior.
In addition, to support this recommendation, the door undercuts should be a minimum 10mm with all of
them below this level.
The gaps uphold make-up air being able to be drawn in under the doors from other parts of the property
by working extractors in line with the recommended ‘whole dwelling ventilation rate’.
There were a number of passive wall plates noted in areas of the dwelling with all but one sealed. Although
they can act like trickle vents during summer periods, they can have an adverse effect in the winter by
cooling the localised structure such that, when warm air comes into contact with it, condensation can
occur being a key nutrient for mould. Mould tend to struggle to develop on structures that demonstrate
even surface temperatures across them and, there was no evidence of this at the time of the survey.
However a recent ‘whitewash’ undertaking was advised to the author and is not sure if this embraced
fungicidal products for the most effective removal.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author the areas of damp noted in the dwelling are linked to structural
related issues that will require invasive investigations in order to determine the likely cause.
However, in the first instance it may be worth considering closing off the open chimneys from a rain ingress
perspective to be able to monitor any further deterioration of the clear damp chimney breast and
associated walls. To assist this the internal plaster would ideally need to be removed to allow the brick to
breathe.
There remains a number of likely causes for this problem hence it is recommended if there is no
improvement, an invasive undertaking in areas of the lounge walls is considered as a simple and least
disruptive approach to aid the process of inspecting the cavity and confirming the walls are (or not) built
off the slab to aid determining the presence of a DPM across the dwelling footprint.",1
0073_RH11.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0)
and confirmed a dry condition in all areas surveyed in
particular, the areas pointed out by the tenant where
mould growth has been an issue. No significant mould
was noted at the time of the survey with the tenant
mentioning some redecoration has been carried out.
With regard to ventilation of the property it was noted the bathroom fan was running on arrival (Section
6.1.2) however, tests showed the flow rate was below that specified in the building regs. However,
considering the run on after the light is switched of the unit would be effective in controlling the
humidity in this area. Observations made would possibly suggest the bathroom extractor is being
switched off at the isolator.",3

Report
1.0 Property:
A former water tower constructed approximately 120
years ago of engineering or semi engineering bricks,
assumed to be jointed with Hydraulic lime mortar.
Former window or opening recesses have now been
glazed with Alloy DG windows and new openings
formed at the base for patio door and access to a
glazed link structure adjoining new construction
housing bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and hallway.
2.0 Incident:
I am advised that in the last 2-3 years rain water has been getting into the Tower brickwork particularly
around the reveals head and cills of the tall windows also around the head of the arched window
opening in the ground floor sitting room where the former door (prior to conversion) was present and
the reveals of the patio door to the sitting room where a new opening has been formed in the tower
base.
I was also advised of an additional problem of subsidence to a structural brick pillar. This was unrelated
to the water issue but affecting the adjoining structure and have therefore commented on this.
3.0 History of the Tower
Built in 1898 by the then Cardiff Corporation to serve the local community with water at a constant
pressure. The water tower became redundant many years ago and was grade II listed as a rare surviving
tower associated with urban water supply and a prominent structure of distinctive character.
A report in the Western Mail for 2005 states that The Tower was acquired by a local developer and
extensively refurbished over a 2 year period into a distinctive and extensive 4 bedroom property. It was
then sold to the current owners in 2007.
4.0 Inspection and findings
Whilst our inspection commenced at the bottom of the tower and then progressed up to the top
viewing terrace, I have reported in reverse order to our survey as this helps explain the passage of
moisture down through the structure which is influenced as much by gravity as it will by capillary action
within this large mass of masonry.
A unique architectural feature of this property is its castellated copings, however an inspection of these
reveals that the work carried out by the developer to conserve that part of the building in 2005/6 was
very superficial to make it cosmetically appear to be in good condition.
The castellations and Crenulations on the top of the tower have been constructed on top of the
brickwork to give the appearance of fortified battlements. This feature has been constructed using large
hand carved sandstone blocks. The jointing compound between the blocks would probably have been
similar to that used in the brickwork structure. The original masons probably used hydraulic lime slurry
mixed with sandstone dust to achieve the very narrow bed joints between the original sandstone
masonry.
It can be seen in images 7.1 to 7.3 that the vertical joints are open to the weather and that these have
been gradually washed out and/or moved apart by freeze/thaw action. The re-pointing work carried out
by the developer at this level is again superficial and will have had only a minimal effect in preventing
water from entering the joints of the sandstone blocks.
Water will inevitably penetrate downwards between the sandstone units and enter the matrix of
brickwork that it rests upon. Here it will gradually disperse out into the structure. There is already
evidence of this happening on the Westerly facing brick quoin immediately beneath the South West
Corner Castellation. Salts are staining the brickwork as it evaporates out of the structure on this
elevation which is exposed to both wind and driving rain.
The internal part of the structure at this high level is coated with a fibreglass membrane over the inside
walls to the inset stairwell and up to the underside of the powder coated steel or aluminium flashing
fixed around the walls above the terrace level. See sections 7.4 and 7.5 below.
Moving down to the next level, of noticeable water ingress into the tower is the corbelled brickwork
over the tall window heads. Poor detailing and inappropriate sand/cement flaunching has been applied
to the brick corbelling. Picture 7.6 and close up 7.7 shows what appears to be a hard rendered area
dressed off at an angle to form a flaunched top surface over the brick corbelling. This has clearly been
applied in a non uniform manner, leaving exposed feather edges of mortar where a weakness will occur
allowing water to seep back under the render. It is also likely this has not been let into the brickwork
joint above and therefore a vulnerable vertical edge where it joins the top face is likely to be present.
Bearing in mind the poor standard of preservation and pointing and detailing used elsewhere I feel that
this area warrants closer examination.
4.1 Internally
The principal areas of water ingress to the first floor rooms in the tower are around the window reveals.
It is the opinion of the author that the developer has applied some form of tanking or waterproof
plastering to the reveals of the window and possibly also to the walls of the structure behind the dry
lining. Otherwise I would have expected a damp atmosphere to be very prevalent in The Tower.
An indication there might be tanking to the internal walls beneath the plaster is the fact that where
water is coming through, it is in small patches but around this, the area is dry. Water is also not leaking
through in large volumes, but is more akin to migration of moisture through a defective tanking
membrane where the area is being wetted but not saturated.
The age and condition of the brickwork together with the fact that even with perfect pointing the
brickwork will at times be wet because of the Towers design construction and exposure, if a tanking
membrane was not present I would have expected the whole of the reveals to be wet, stained and
substantially deteriorated. It would also be wet most of the year if not all year.
Condensation can be ruled out as there is considerable efflorescence on each damp area indicating that
moisture is coming out of the wall bringing salts with it.
further investigation. I suspect that no DPC or tray has been installed in the opening or above the
window. Alternatively if the developer did install a horizontal DPC it is not overlapped and draining
forwards at the ends or linked to a vertical DPC. Hence water is getting into the tops of both reveals
internally.
The semi circular window opening shown in sections 7.10 to 7.12 is likely to be a square opening behind
the single skin brick arch. Once again, a sound tanking system would be needed here to prevent
moisture ingress and I believe the system used is defective. Further investigation is required to asses the
extent of work in this area.
Finally at the lower level the ground floor rooms are primarily affected by moisture ingress at the heads
of the windows. Once again water is clearly able to easily penetrate into the wall where the sandstone
and brick corbelling detail is set into the wall at around 3.00 metres from ground level. Pictures 7.14
through to 7.18 clearly show the poor condition of the masonry at this level which has received no
cursory attention to repointing.
There is the risk of fungal growth on organic materials used to construct the arched window reveals on
the ground floor sitting room and section 7.10 shows a small area of what appears to be fungal growth.
This area should be opened up for further investigation.
4.2 External brick pillar
The existing end support pillar carrying the steel support to the corner of the new part of the
development is clearly subsiding and rotating outwards at the top towards the west. The aluminium trim
to the glazed corner of the dining area is being put under excessive load and it is the opinion of the
author that currently the steel beam contained inside this brick feature is pivoting over the corner of the
glazing.
I understand that this is being dealt with under a separate buildings insurance claim, however I would
stress the importance to attend to this quickly and insert some temporary supports to remove the load
being transferred onto the glazing and stop any further rotation as this will damage the structural
connection into the main part of the building.
5.0 Conclusions
Cardiff Bay is a category 4 weather exposure zone, is the highest level in the UK and classified as a ""very
severe weather rating"". The Tower is also exceptionally exposed to the elements as there are no other
geographical features, structures or trees offering any form of protection from wind or driven rain. As
such, the standard of masonry jointing needs to be extremely high to withstand prolonged exposure to
the elements. It is a testimony to the original masons skills on this structure that it has lasted so well in
such an exposed position.
As explained earlier I am of the opinion the original builders used hydraulic lime slurry to achieve a well
jointed brick matrix. The exclusive use of this lime mix and the narrow bedding and perpendicular joints
has been paramount to it still being in a reasonable condition after 120 years.
The coloured brick pointing mortar used by the developer in 2005/6 to re-point the brickwork on the
Tower appears to have a high cementitious content. If the developer can provide evidence of its make
up and gauging it would be useful otherwise this should be analysed in a laboratory to determine the
exact composition.
It will in my opinion be impossible to prevent moisture ingress into the Tower in the same way that it
would be for a new build property. The construction of this tower from solid brickwork and stone means
that it will always be susceptible to being moist/wet. It might appear dry on the surface at some periods
of the year when weather conditions are dry. However the thickness of the masonry and its exposure to
the elements mean that it will always absorb some moisture which will permeate into the structure to a
reasonable depth if not right through in places.
The application of StormDry Masonry protection Cream or any other liquid applied products can only be
as effective as the depth to which the masonry will be dry and able to absorb the cream. It is necessary
to have the building thoroughly clean and free of all loose material. All joints should be properly pointed
and in this respect this building is not up to a good enough standard to apply the product.
It is my view that the only sensible approach to this building is to repoint the walls properly. Initially this
could be done at the most vulnerable areas which are:
a) The Castellations and Crenulations on the head of the building including the flashing detail around the
internal terrace.
b) The brick corbelling immediately below the top of the tower and above the high level windows.
c) The sandstone corbelling above the ground floor level where it can be clearly seen there are large
holes where water will get into the walls.
Whilst carrying out selective works to the building, care will need to be taken where there are areas of
algae growth on the sandstone. The low level sandstone has extensive algae growth that might be
exacerbated by the change in Ph level of the water running down the building. The sandstone is already
showing signs of damage so care should be taken in cleaning this off as further damage might occur with
incorrect or inappropriate cleaning. There is good guidance on the internet and in particular
The original joints have been raked out by no more than a few millimetres and as such the pointing is all
superficial. It could not have been packed into the joint to any effective depth and has not been carried
out using proper pointing irons. The pointing material is in my opinion too hard and very brittle, but I
would stress that further investigation is needed to give an accurate opinion on its suitability.
Notwithstanding, this is already deteriorating quickly and with successive freezing of moisture which will
inevitably get trapped behind it then deterioration will accelerate and only last a few years.
Cementitious mortar has the tendency to trap moisture in the brickwork only letting it out through the
bricks themselves. This causes damage to the bricks. See section 3.4 below.
The following in Italics is extracted from ""Pembrokeshire County Council Advice Note Nov 2006. Pointing
with Lime Mortars. By R Barrett-Evans (Est. Man.)MRICS"" - Pages 3 & 4.
3.0 THE ADVANTAGES OF LIME OVER CEMENT
3.1 Lime-based buildings expand, contract and flex with changes in temperature and moisture. The use
of lime also allows damp to be absorbed to a limited degree and then evaporate harmlessly away. Our
ancestors accepted that rain and rising damp were bound to find a way into the walls of their houses, so
they built them thick, and the soft, permeable mortars and renders acted as wick to draw moisture out
again.
3.2 Modern construction techniques generally rely on a cement mortar to create rigid foundations and
walls which allow a minimum movement and restrict the passage of moisture. (movement in large areas
of masonry is allowed by expansion joints). Damp is kept out of the structure by damp proof courses,
cement renders, water proof paints and cavity walls.
3.3 Not quoted as this refers to render.
3.4 If lime-based masonry is pointed with a cement mortar which is less permeable than the stones or
bricks (most cement mortars are), then the moisture will be forced out of the wall through the block
themselves, causing erosion in that part of the wall which is most difficult to repair. In frosty weather this
leads to the rapid deterioration of both stones and bricks as the moisture in them freezes.
3.5 Where the cement pointing is harder than the stone or brick, deterioration may also be caused by the
development of stress in the face of the wall. Stress arises because walls move gradually with changes in
temperature and moisture content; old lime mortar in the core of the wall acts like a cushion,
accommodating expansion and contraction, transferring loads onto the narrow depth of the wall which
has been repointed. If the stone or brick is softer than the mortar, the edges of the stone will shear and
'spall'. (In modern construction the movement is accommodated by dividing large areas cemented
masonry into panels separated by flexible joints usually filled with mastic).
3.6 Even more damage has been caused to old masonry where the joints have been made to project
beyond the face of the wall with a hard band of cement. Not only does this look wrong, but also provides
small ledges all over the wall face which encourage moisture penetration and promote decay.
3.7 Cement pointing has often been 'buffered' over existing eroded joints without proper penetration
being made, making the joints appear much wider than they really are. These feather-thin edges tend to
crack into sections and become detached from the wall, inviting rain and damp into the structure. In
some ways this helps in the preparation of the wall prior to repointing as poor pointing is often easier to
remove, having already cracked. It can often be picked off by hand!
4.0 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
4.1 The choice of a mortar will be influenced by the need to maintain the historic interest of the building,
its structural integrity, and its appearance from the historical perspective. Repointing should be carried
out using the same material as originally used, in the same proportions and to the same technique,
including the same aggregate, binder and other additives unless the original specification is at fault.
However, it is often difficult to determine what is 'original' and it is better to err on the side of caution,
using a suitable lime-putty based mortar than to recreate mistakes made in the past.
4.2 From a practical point of view, a masonry wall should be pointed with careful chosen lime mortar,
which is just softer and more porous than the material with which the wall is constructed, and the mortar
should be finished flush or slightly recessed from the face of the brick or stone (see figure 5). Any
problems which do occur are therefore more likely to affect the mortar which can be repaired through
periodic repointing. This is easier and cheaper than having to replace whole areas of masonry.
5.1 Discussion over the use of Stormdry or any similar products derived from silicone.
The fundamental principle of conservation is to alleviate the problems affecting a building or monument
in a way that doesn't detract from its history and doesn't endanger but promotes its future. This should
be done, wherever possible, with the absolute minimum of intervention and in a way that is reversible
should a better way come along in the future.
The suggested treatment of the towers exterior walls with a water repellent emulsion/cream has
apparently been approved for use on this building. I am unsure as to what body gave this approval and
to what extent they actually examined the building beforehand. Notwithstanding, I am surprised that it
has been approved as being suitable to solve the problems of water ingress into the structure.
The suggested product(s) all contain a mixture of silane and siloxanes and I quote as follows:
Silanes and siloxanes, are the two most common penetrating sealers. Both are derived from the silicone
family. Despite being very closely related, they have significant performance differences. Unlike silanes,
which require a high pH to catalyze, siloxanes are not dependent on substrate pH. Because of this,
siloxanes are ideal for treating brick, stucco, and stone. Because silanes are made up of smaller
molecules than siloxanes, they typically will obtain deeper penetration than siloxanes. As a result, silanes
perform well under abrasion and weathering. A consequence, however, of this small molecular size is
that silanes are relatively volatile. Therefore, the solids content of a silane product should be high enough
to compensate for the loss of reactive material through evaporation during application and cure.
Siloxanes, because they are less volatile, generally offer good water repellent performance at lower
initial cost than do silanes. However, for concrete surfaces subjected to abrasive wear such as pavements
and decks, treatment with a silane sealer will provide longer lasting protection. In regard to surface
texture and colour, treatment with silane sealers typically cannot be detected visually. Siloxane products
may slightly darken the treated surface. Reference ""Master Builders Construction Products Handbook,""
Master Builders Inc., 1993.
Further tests are required but I am of the opinion that the quality of the brick used in the Tower is likely
to be to the standard of an engineering brick. Typically Class A bricks have strength of 125N/mm² and
water absorption of less than 4.5%; Class B bricks have strength greater than 75N/mm² and water
absorption of less than 7%.
Engineering bricks have been used in the past as a damp proof course on earlier structures. It is
therefore feasible that if the brick is a very low porosity, it is likely that the passage of water through the
structure to the internal envelope is primarily through the joints in the brickwork. The sandstone
copings, castellations and crenulations all have a very low porosity and are unlikely to be letting water
through the mass of stone, only at the joints.
There is an argument to say that if the brickwork jointing is poor and letting in water, then the solution is
to re-point this properly with a material that is correctly gauged and mixed to provide maximum
protection whilst still being completely compatible with the existing jointing mortar and therefore not
detrimental to the structure.
The use of liquid or cream water repellents would be alien to the composition of materials used in the
original construction of this Grade II listed structure. Most manufactures of such materials make claims
that this does not affect the structure. My view is that any chemical process or external application will
fundamentally change the way the building performs since originally constructed. It can only be as long
lasting as to the amount of material that can be absorbed into the structure. Absorption will be
dependant upon a number of factors, not the least of which is the dryness of the substrate. In this
instance the substrate of brick might be relatively dry and it is only the deeper sections of jointing
mortar that are very wet. Sound re-pointing will prevent the uptake of moisture into the joints and also
make it difficult to absorb any useable quantities of waterproofing material.
All manufactures of Silane and Siloxane waterproofing emulsions will request that their product is
applied to dry, sound, clean, dust free and organic growth free substrates. The works required to
achieve this would involve re-pointing to a high conservation standard, which as it is shown above might
well be sufficient to achieve the desired reduction in moisture into the wall and if done properly, this will
last for many years more than a waterproofing liquid that by its very nature will be gradually broken
down or washed out, especially on those elevations that are very exposed.
It is therefore the opinion of the author that sound perseveration and conservation techniques of re-
pointing with an appropriate material will achieve the desired effect of slowing down the penetration of
water into the structure such that the volume of moisture in the structure is at manageable levels. This
coupled with internal works to correct the defects in tanking (assuming it exists) will achieve a structure
that is dry to a liveable standard.
7.0 Structural problems and photographs:
7.1 Perpendicular jointing between the castellations
and Crenulations is allowing water into the sandstone
masonry that is collecting in the brickwork levels that
this is constructed upon.
7.2 Perpendicular joints on the Quoin castellations
show signs of very poor repair and pointing not only
by the developers but also in the last 50 years or so.
Clearly sand and cement has been used where a lime
and sandstone dust mix should have been used along
with areas of new stonework where jointing was too
large to be an appropriate repair or renovation
technique. Damage and movement of blocks will
occur as a result of freezing and expansion of ice.
7.3 As above
7.4 There is a folded powder coated steel flashing
inset into the brickwork wall below the sandstone
castellation and Crenulations. Below this the brick
walls have been coated with fibreglass on the inside of
the tower to make this open area watertight down to
the next floor level as it is effectively open to the
elements. It is also likely that this area was part of the
original water tank that might well have been
rendered. As such any moisture in this part of the
structure can only go down or outwards as the
fibreglass is moisture and vapour impermeable.
7.5 As above. Close inspection revealed that this
flashing was only minimally embedded into the wall
and the pointing in was carried out very poorly.
7.6 The brick corbelling above the window level in the
tower showed a flaunching of what appears to be
sand and cement applied to the top surface of the
brick corbelling. I presume this detail was an attempt
to throw water off the structure. However closer
examination revealed that the flaunching is short of
the outside edge of the brickwork, making it
vulnerable to moisture ingress and frost damage. It
should be inspected further and ideally replaced with
lead jointed into the main structure and to form a
drip.
7.7 A detail of the above picture at 7.6 shows where
the flaunching is only partially covering the brickwork
corbelling. There are also open joints in this corbelling
where water will get down into the brickwork.
There also other defects in the pointing where water
can get into the brickwork through open joints.
7.8 It is my opinion that the developer will have
applied a tanking system to the inside face of the
brickwork structure. The evidence of REL moisture
meter reading being at maximum in areas where the
walls are dry together with other areas where
moisture has been visibly leaching through and is
showing WME readings between 25 and 100%, would
indicate to me that the tanking medium used has only
been partially successful.
7.9 As above. There are areas at low level on the
glazed tower windows where the wall is wet with
adjacent dry areas, indicating a breakdown in the
tanking system and an ineffective system. The window
reveal at the high level has some areas with a WME
reading near 100% but they are localised. Adjacent
areas a short distance away will be showing as normal
around 14%.
7.10 There is a protrusion at the head of the ground
floor arched window. This requires further
investigation as it is clearly very moist and I cannot be
certain without removing the plaster, but could be a
type of fungal growth.
7.11 The REL reading at the head of the window is
100%
7.12 The arched window was formerly a door and the
internal reveals are likely to be square behind the
brick arch. This would indicate that there is a
substantial amount of construction behind this which
is getting wet and might include wet timber.
7.13 The corner detail on the window head is not
sealed and might not be linked with the vertical DPC.
Further investigation is needed to determine if further
works are required here.
There is no drip to the brickwork to throw water
forward away from the lintel
7.14 note the green algae building up on the
sandstone corbelling. Likely causes of this are the
alkalinity of the new mortar used in pointing the walls
and or little or no sunlight at this level.
The pattern of staining shows that the volumes of
water washing down over this are not insubstantial.
Therefore it is vitally important that the pointing to all
joints is effective.
7.15 The brickwork panel to the left of this patio door
has had no pointing carried out to the centre of it.
7.16 Here is a detail at the base of the ""dummy""
window reveals on the West elevation above the patio
door corner at 7.14 above. Open joints and poor re-
pointing has resulted in numerous holes in the
structure where water will get in. It is likely that in a
heavy wind driven rainstorm the volumes of water
hitting these surfaces will be equivalent to a waterfall
the height of this tower.
7.17 It is my opinion that the sandstone corbelling
blocks will have been recessed into the brick masonry
wall to a depth of one brick header i.e. 220 mm, but it
could only be one half brick i.e. 110 mm. either way,
an open on the top surface as shown here will be
subjected to very high volumes of water during heavy
rain which can enter the structure and get onto the
head of the window blow or just behind as they have
been set in the front of the reveal to maximise
internal space.
7.18 This picture shows the typical poor standard of
pointing to The Tower. It is superficial, insufficient
depth to be long lasting or effective and missing in
very many places. The quality of workmanship is
amateurish and was unlikely to have been carried out
by tradesmen who are highly experienced or qualified
to carry repointing work to a listed building.
The pointing material is not consistent with the
mortar used in the original construction and therefore
could be deleterious to the structure if not
compatible.
7.19 The brick pier supporting the steel carrying the
corner of the new part of the development (see
below) is rotating towards the west and moving
down/subsiding. The loss of end support to what
appears to be a simply end supported beam is
transferring some of the load onto the corner of the
glazing. This is buckling the aluminium window
framing and I suspect that the glazing is now under
load.
7.20 Temporary supports are required under the LHS
of the opening in the position shown by the red arrow.
These should be tightened up to remove all structure
loads off the glazing and framing. Ideally return the
steel to its original position but care should be taken
not to force upwards in case there has been some
movement in the upper part of the structure. The
base of the temporary supports should spread the
load over a wide area at the paving level as this has
settled and might potentially be unstable. Propping
should be regularly checked for movement until the
reconstruction of the supporting pier and foundations
have been completed.",0
0260_TA6.pdf,"The walls and floor to the rear of the bedroom damp with mould spots occurring on the walls.
Externally to this area gutters are dipping down in the middle and are also blocked and
overflowing. Gutters around the rest of the building are also in a similar state.
Is my opinion the damp in the rear bedroom caused by water from the overflowing gutters
running down over the solid concrete walls and effectively keeping them permanently wet.
Because the floor in this building has no damp proof membrane other than thermoplastic floor
tiles or vinyl, the volume of water is also affecting the ground to the rear area which is making
the floor damp. Will also have the effect to cool wall which in turn creates a cold spot for
condensation.
I recommend that after mechanical ventilation has been installed and all disrepair issues have
been corrected in this property, a follow-up survey should be carried out after 6 to 9 months. If
any of the issues still continue it will be easier to spot if there are any other underlying defects.
The tenants sleep with the bedroom windows closed. This is because top hung design of the
Windows does not give them the feeling of adequate security. A better design would be windows
top fanlight would allow for night-time ventilation but not allow for easy access into the property
by forcing the window. Whilst I realise that this is not a disrepair issue it might be worth
considering changing the design next time these windows are due to be replaced. Or fitting a
suitable security system to ensure that if open at night they cannot then be forced open. Top hung
windows of this design and external opening doors adjacent to a path serving more than one
dwelling might also be a health and safety risk.",1
0212_RM3.pdf,"The survey was carried out between 9:30 and approximately 11:00 am on a clear bright day with direct
sunlight affecting the south facing rear elevation. As detailed it is the bedroom areas to the north facing
elevation which are the areas of concern.
The wall structures through the property were surveyed and reasonably even surface temperatures
were noted across the surveyed external wall areas to both the north and south facing elevations. There
was an average temperature drop of 3.5°C between the north and south facing elevations.
Observations to the small bedroom showed the radiator to be obscured and it was confirmed the owner
tends not to heat this room (Section 6.2). As the temperature drops in the small bedroom it will tend to
draw heat from the adjoining areas. It is the opinion of the author the control of the heating in the small
bedroom is a factor in the issues being reported.",1
0196_PO21.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out through the 6 flats to the upper floors and the night
shelter to the basement, the following observations were made:
2.1.1 Upper floor flats:
General observations and recommendations:
Moisture survey:
A detailed moisture survey was carried out throughout the six flats and recorded levels are
representative of the various areas. In general dry structures were indicated with no visible signs of
moisture related damage and mould activity. A number of moderately minor structural moistures were
noted which are detailed below:
Drying laundry:
It was the case in all the surveyed flats that laundry was being dried on radiators and airers to a greater
or lesser extent. The tenants confirmed clothes being dried outside had previously been stolen.
Furniture and contents:
In many of the flats furniture and contents were against external walls and this can create areas of cold
still air which encourages mould activity.
2.1.2 Upper floor flats specific observations and recommendations:
Flat 1:
 The extractor fan unit to the kitchen is not functioning and should be addressed.
 The flow rate for the extractor to the bathroom was below the recommended level and was also
noted the unit needs cleaning.
 Raised structural moisture levels were indicated in two areas of the external wall adjacent to the
bath and toilet with occupational activity most likely plus, a small area at the ceiling level to the
lounge. The latter issues in the lounge are localised and further investigation would be prudent.
With regard to the associated exterior wall a number of cable penetrations were noted which
may be allowing water ingress.
Flat 2:
No issues were raised by the tenant.
 A minor issue was noted with the flow rate of the bathroom extractor although no further
action is recommended.
Flat 3:
No issues were raised by the tenant.
 In general, dry readings were noted with regard to the wall structures through the property
apart from a localised area to the front of the property affecting the bedroom and adjoining
lounge area. The same issue is affecting the corresponding area to flat 5.
 Consider reviewing the ventilation unit to the bathroom for cleanliness and adequate flow rate.
Flat 4:
No issues were raised by the tenant.
 In general, dry readings were noted with regard to the structures with a localised area of raised
capacitance noted to the chimney. No action is required.
 Consider reviewing the ventilation unit to the bathroom for both flow rate and overrun which
were below recommended levels.
Flat 5:
No issues were raised by the tenant.
 In general, dry readings were noted with regard to the wall structures through the property
apart from localised areas to the front of the property affecting the bedroom and adjoining
lounge area. The same issue is affecting the corresponding area to flat 3 and further
investigation is recommended with regard to the cavity detail etc.
 Consider reviewing the ventilation unit to the bathroom for an adequate flow rate.
Flat 6:
No issues were raised by the tenant.
 A dry structure was indicated.
 Consider reviewing the ventilation unit to the bathroom for an adequate flow rate and overrun.
Recommendation for tenants – to control atmospheric moisture levels and mould development:
The consideration and control of atmospheric moisture is a priority and can be achieved by ensuring the
following points are carried out to optimize the internal atmospheric conditions including:
• The use of trickle vents and window ventilation as needed. Opening windows can be very
effective for short periods such as cooking etc. when high atmospheric moisture levels will be
generated. However, leaving windows open for long periods in cold weather will allow the
temperature inside the property to fall and may well make matters worse.
• Where fitted use extractor fans during periods of high moisture production for example, cooking
and bathing etc.
• Ensuring areas of moisture production for example kitchen and bathroom are kept closed
from the general environment until the extraction system has reduced the excessive
atmospheric moisture levels.
• Try not to dry laundry in the property. If there are no options available always provide adequate
ventilation by opening windows preferably providing a cross flow of air through the property.
During the winter months when external temperatures are low or when security is an issue,
drying small volumes of clothing in the bathroom with the door closed and the radiator and
bathroom extractor working, would be a suitable option.
• Where used tumble dryers should be vented to the exterior and washer dryer units should
always be used and maintained as specified by the manufacturer.
• Use the heating in the property to maintain an adequate and even internal air temperature.
• And where possible, move furniture in the property to prevent the build-up of areas of still
cold air against exterior walls.",3
0222_SN10.pdf,"The main area of mould is affecting the Kitchen ceiling and window reveals in the bedrooms however, it
was noted in small traces in other areas.
There are five persons residing at the property plus one dog and two cats. We understand
approximately ten washing loads are undertaken per week although there was no indication of where
the items were subsequently dried. A tumble dryer under the kitchen worktop is not a condensing type
and the tenant advised they move the machine to the window and vent it outside when in use.
Fenestration had closed trickle vents at the time of the survey and some condensation on the windows
may indicate these are closed at nighttime also.
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure with exception of the base of the wall in
bedroom 1 and floor readings. Drilled readings at point G would however suggest this is atmospheric
moisture with no obvious defects to the external wall or DPC at this point. High non-invasive floor
readings would suggest the moisture is likely to be coming from the ground supported slab. Dry
moisture readings taken within the kitchen would also suggest that atmospheric moisture is most likely
contributing to the mould growth on the ceilings.
Issues were noted with the control of the forced ventilation to the bathroom (Section 8.1) and the
kitchen (Section 8.2) whereby both the extractors were switched off at the isolator at the time of the
survey. On test, the bathroom unit had reduced capability in terms of air changes and flow rate but
recognize the unit is humidity controlled.
Based on the observations made during the survey it is the opinion of the author the main driver for the
reported mould activity and condensation is raised atmospheric moisture levels likely generated through
occupational activity and reduced ventilation.",3
0197_PO21.pdf,"A significant number of areas of water ingress were noted with damage to the decorative finishes
occurring as noted on the floor plan (Section 4.0). With regard to the moisture survey (Section 4.1), a
number of areas which indicated significant water related damage in fact displayed dry levels at the time
of the survey. This would tend to suggest the weather ingress is related to significant or wind driven
rainfall. This tended to be the case with regard to the areas of water ingress associated with the uPVC
window units (Section 5.3) where it was noted they have been installed within the original stone
elements of the structure extending from the exterior to the interior (Section 5.3) providing a likely
route for water to migrate to the interior periodically wetting the associated plasterboard dry lining.
With regard to the water ingress affecting the Caretakers cupboard and associated areas (Section 5.2), it
is the opinion of the author the water ingress is ongoing and likely to relate to the building structures
above with the main focus being the copings and parapet walls.
Comments made by the staff at the time of the survey highlighted an issue of water ingress via the uPVC
window units themselves (Section 5.4). Possible issues with the frame drainage may well be the cause
and these would need to be tested.
Further investigations would be required to clearly identify the areas of water ingress as detailed in the
report and would likely require access to the flat roofs in particular the parapets and copings.",0
0223_SN10.pdf,"We are advised there are two washing loads processed per week with the clothes being dried within the
confines of the flat. At the time of the survey, mould and condensation was present in every room and aligns to
a lack of adequate ventilation through the property.
Remote humidity monitoring devices were placed within the flat and, due to security issues were not able to
deploy a remote humidity monitoring device outside. In addition, moisture readings have been recorded
throughout the flat along with some thermal pictures to assist determining the current internal conditions.
20 th November 2015:
Observations indicate clothing is being dried within the flat and with all windows closed at this time, will be
adding to the current issues being experienced. Condensation was evident through all areas especially to the
windows. The atmospheric conditions indicated during this survey (section 5.2) under protocols laid out as per
BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation being
classified as ‘damp’.
26 th November 2015:
In support of the above observations, the exterior cavity wall directly opposite to where high non-invasive
readings were recorded, was drilled. Cavity wall insulation was observed and readings of this and the interior
leaf indicated they were dry. The moisture survey (section 5.4) indicated high surface readings mainly to the
base of the walls and is regarded as consistent with ongoing condensation. Suffice to add, the thermal images
in section 6.0 indicate condensation was occurring at the time of our second survey and an invasive reading at
survey location ‘D’ showed a considerable reduction from 56.8% at the surface to 24% WME at 24mm deep.
Outcome:
20a Picton House, Hussar Court, Westside View, Waterlooville, Hampshire, PO7 7SQ
From the information gathered and with a dry structure, it is the opinion of the author the issues being
experienced within the property are due to atmospheric conditions being encouraged by occupational activities
and a lack of adequate heating and ventilation. The atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey under
protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point
to the occupation being classified as ‘WET’ (see section 6.2).
During the second survey the windows were opened and the atmospheric conditions improved whilst on site
(see section 5.2) such that the specific humidity was in line with the exterior. The ambient conditions also
improved to the extent a sense of damp (due to Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds – mould likely to be
active) was reduced. However, a continued lack of adequate heat has allowed the structure to cool leading to
an early onset of condensation when conditions allow.
It is vital the following recommendations are observed with a view to reducing the issues within the property.",3
0298_W9.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.2) showed clearly the loss affected area is focused on the bathroom and
in particular, the bath. The accessible plumbing to the bathroom area was inspected (Section 5.1) and no
leaks were identified.
The area under the bath was found to be saturated and
the image shows clearly the mould activity plus the
puddle caused by the short water test. The bath seal was
shown to have failed across the head and down the side
of the bath. Across the head the wall plaster under the
bath has been eroded by loss water flowing past the seal
when the shower is used.
It is the opinion of the author the source of moisture
causing the issues through the loss affected area is the
failed bath seal and was confirmed the bath is used daily.
It was confirmed the issues had been ongoing for an extended period of time and were first noted soon
after Ms. Collins moved into the property.",0
0217_SE5.pdf,"At the time of this survey, the information gathered from investigations of the boxed-in sections
suggested that the DPC in the party wall between flats 1 and 2 is likely to have been compromised. It
was noted that running parallel to this section of wall was a channel open to the ground facilitating
waste pipework, furthermore no DPC or DPM was observed at this time. Slightly elevated readings
compared to the previous site visit at points B,D,E and L would suggest the underfloor waste pipe void
continues to service the bathroom and possibly the kitchen. Readings taken on the second site visit were
consistent with readings taken at the time of the initial visit.
The bedroom of Flat 1 is observed to be approximately 150mm higher in finished floor level than that of
the adjoining Flat 2 bedroom and both connect to the rear elevation of the original timber suspended
floor structure.
It is therefore the authors opinion that to confirm the above, further extensive invasive investigation to
the wall/floor junction in both flats 1 and 2 would be needed to confirm the nature of the compromised
DPC and the presence of an effective DPM.
This is likely to involve supporting trades to effect the removal of skirting’s and floorboards, stripping of
plaster and removal of some brickwork to confirm the extent of the problem and will also likely form the
basis for a remedial schedule of works.",0
0101_BN17.pdf,"There is one adult and two children living at the property producing two to three washing loads per
week. The washing is predominantly dried in the bathroom although some is dried on radiators. The
occupant moved into the property in March 2015 and noticed some damp and mould growing in late
October, and are advised this was painted over and not treated.
Two additional vents had been added for ventilation in the lounge although it was noted that at the time
of the survey all trickle vents were closed but in good working order. The occupant informed us that an
extractor was due to be fitted in the bathroom where the mould had previously been. The 100mm
diameter Envirovent extractor in the kitchen was operated on a pull chord and on test recorded a flow
rate of 3.2 m/s which equates to 25.14 l/s which is below the recommended flow rate of 59 l/sec when
located away from a hob.
It was noted that most furniture was resting against the perimeter walls as were many other items and
will restrict the airflow in these areas likely leading to cold spots in the property.
Following investigation of the property there appeared to be some minor structural defects which the
occupant said were in the process of being addressed. These specifically would be the addition of an
extractor in the bathroom and repairs to the window flashing and pointing in bedroom 2, location ‘U’ on
the moisture map in Section 5.1.
Apart from an isolated reading at location ‘U’, all other elevated readings were consistently at the base
of the wall and is indicative of likely cold and condensation forming at the base as it meets the cold
ground supported slab. Localised drilled readings in bedroom 1 confirmed the fabric of the building as
dry in this location where elevated surface readings were recorded. A high floor reading at location ‘4’
on the moisture map was taken in the kitchen directly in front of the kitchen sink and is believed to be
related to the activity in the kitchen at the time of survey.
The occupant has commented on mould on shoes and clothes in her wardrobe and in the children’s
room. Mould on contents items is indicative of prevailing elevated atmospheric conditions and is the
authors opinion the property is displaying signs of high internal atmospheric moisture and condensation
forming at low level as a result.
It is the opinion of the author the property suffers increased internal atmospheric conditions leading to
instances of condensation mainly caused by inadequate ventilation and the drying of clothes within the
property.",3
0105_BN21.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out down through the property. This has highlighted
consistency in the areas of concern affecting the upper floor flats. Namely the assumed to be redundant
chimney detail to the small bedroom. This structure is solid brick and clearly part of the exterior wall
structure. It is the opinion of the author this area has been primarily affected by water ingress through
the exterior wall renders which may well now have been remediated by the works recently carried out.
A review of the exterior did highlight areas where continued water ingress is likely for example areas of
the flank wall to the property and detailing around penetrations of the external render such as boiler
flues and window detailing etc.
Localized focused restorative drying may well be a consideration in a number of areas through the
property (Section 9.3). Combined with a detailed review of the exterior of the property with the aim of
identify on-going areas of water ingress.
With regard to the lower ground floor flat, flat 1. Observations suggested damp remediation works have
been carried out in a number of areas, observations would suggest these include the application of
damp inhibit render finishes to wall structures. A clear understanding of previous remedial works carried
would be required prior to developing further works in this area.
With regard to the forced ventilation of bathroom, en-suite areas and kitchens down through the
property a number of significant issues were highlighted in each property surveyed.",1
0039_LU3.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was undertaken which revealed no raised moisture levels throughout
confirming a dry structure (See section 4.3 & 4.4)
Trickle vents were found to be open and in a good condition at the time of the survey. It was advised
that 2/3 years ago a positive pressure ventilation system was introduced which supposedly did not help
and instead made the flat cold. This unit has now been removed.
Two 100mm extraction units were noted within the kitchen and in the wet room which run via a
continuous mode with the option of a boosted mode via the pull cord. These units appear to be
controlled via changes in atmospheric conditions as it was advised that the unit within the wet room
goes into boost mode when the shower is in use. It was reported however that the boost mode to the
unit within the kitchen must be activated via the pull cord.
Furniture items were seen to be directly in front of the external wall within both bedrooms as well as
the lounge which could lead to cold spots and in turn possible mould development. At survey location
point A, a small chest of drawers was set back from the external wall with slight mould development
noted at base level.
Mould was noted at base level around both the front and back doors and was also present near survey
location point G at the base of the external wall.
The tenant advised that due to mould development within bedroom 1 furniture items have had to be
replaced three times with clothing being disposed of.
It is the opinion of the surveyor that any mould development noted is likely a result of the occupational
activity and the furniture being in front for external walls causing cold spots and then condensation.",3
0144_E8.pdf,"Water staining is affecting the plasterboard ceiling to the
bedroom area to the north facing side elevation of the
property plus the ceiling area associated with the sky light
to the hallway. The moisture survey (Section 4.0) showed
clearly all the loss affected areas were dry at the time of
the survey suggesting an ongoing water ingress was
unlikely. An inspection of the asphalted flat roof did not
highlight any obvious areas which would suggest a water
ingress (Section 7.1).
An invasive investigation carried out into the timber roof structure suggested there is no vapour control
membrane incorporated in the roof structure on the warm side of the roof insulation (Section 7.2). The
lighting units through the property are downlights which will significantly increase the movement of
warm damp air from the living areas into the roof structure. It is the opinion of the author interstitial
condensation is the driving factor for the issues being experienced. Issues were highlighted with the
forced ventilation to the bathroom and en-suite (Section 6.1) which will increase the atmospheric
moisture load in the property.
If required an electronic leak detection survey can be carried out with regard to the asphalt flat roof
membrane. However this will require invasive internal intervention to establish an earth for the survey
equipment.",0
0047_ME1.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the flat which revealed elevated moisture levels on both
wall and ceiling surfaces in a number of locations likely driven by surface condensation.
Regarding how the flat is ventilated, a working mechanical extraction unit in the bathroom requires attention with no
unit in the kitchen. There are passive wall vents in both bedrooms and the kitchen which appears to have been
blocked. In addition, most passive trickle vents were open and was also noted all windows were closed at the time.
Observations clearly revealed condensation is a major issue with droplets falling from ceiling surfaces and around
windows frames pooling on the cills, in turn is also staining wall surfaces. In addition, mould was observed above
and around mainly window reveals.
Based upon observations made plus the thermal imaging section the author is of the opinion, concerns raised by the
tenants will be a combination of elevated raised internal humidity levels and inadequate ventilation supported by
calculations made under BS5250:2002 confirming a “wet” occupancy and clearly showing condensation was
occurring at the time of this survey.

0043_LU4.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the flat which confirmed a dry structure and, regarding
ventilation measures there are mechanical extraction units in the kitchen and wet room with neither performing in
compliance with current Regulations. Background passive trickle vents were noted which were all blocked at the
time of the survey.
These elements could readily align to the calculated BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in
buildings: Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied buildings; which indicated a ‘moist’ atmosphere
at the time.
Visual observations confirmed mould at the base of wall surfaces mainly behind the lounge sofa and behind the bed
in the bedroom.
No other issues were noted and, in conclusion is the author’s opinion the reported concerns are driven by a
combination of raised internal humidity levels and inadequate ventilation supported by the underperforming
extraction units, blocked trickle vents leading to the formation of condensation on colder wall areas behind
contents due to a lack of adequate circulation.

0100_BN16.pdf,"Five adults live at property, four of which are in residence mostly during the day and we are advised
there are 3 washing loads processed per week either dried outside or, with the use of clothes horse set
up in the kitchen.
The Wickes 150mm diameter extraction unit in the kitchen operates via a pull cord separate to the light
switch. The outer casing to the unit is damaged which results in cold air coming in. The flow rate was
below the recommended requirement for this location and with no overrun, there is a reliance on it
being manually operated when the kitchen is in use.
100mm Advent extraction unit in the shower room is advised to operate via a pull cord with the light
switch but was not in use at time of the survey. A number of contents however were being stored in the
shower and the tenant confirmed this shower is rarely used. Outing casing was noted to be damaged.
In the bathroom a 100mm Vent-Axia unit operates via a pull cord separate to the light switch with no
overrun and was noted to be in a poor condition. On test the flow rate was also below the
recommended requirement for a bathroom. And as with the kitchen, a unit with no overrun relies on it
being remaining is operation after the bathroom has been used to dispel excessive atmospheric
conditions.
All windows were fitted with trickle vents but were closed at time of visit as were most of the windows.
A detailed moisture survey of the property (section 5.0 – 5.4) indicated in general a dry structure other
than the slightly raised moisture level to the floor in the bathroom likely due to a defective bath seal
(section 7.5).
Based on BS5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: the occupation would
be graded as a ‘moist’ occupation based on the levels recorded at the time of the survey (Section 5.6). It
is therefore the opinion of the author the likely cause of the mould noted in the property is being driven
by raised internal atmospheric conditions and a lack of ventilation. Consideration should therefore be
given to the installation of effective forced ventilation units and their use be considered in line with the
following recommendations.",3
0131_DA10.pdf,"A moisture survey was completed throughout the flat which confirmed a dry structure.
Regarding ventilation measures, there are mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen/lounge plus, open passive trickle vents
noted in the kitchen and bedroom. The extraction unit in the kitchen/lounge is currently operating below recommendations set out in part F of
building regs which will have an impact on controlling periods of raised internal humidity levels. Furthermore, it was observed all door undercuts
were less than 10mm which is also a recommendation in part F of the building regs to aid air circulation and make-up air entering bathrooms and
kitchens assisting the extraction of generated moisture air.
The occupancy section set out below and in accordance with BS5250:2021 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: Annex
B generation and ventilation in occupied buildings: confirmed a “moist” occupancy which aligns to a lack of adequate ventilation.
The thermal survey supported this by indicating surface condensation was an issue with mould able to be sustained on wall surfaces especially in
the area of concern to the tenant within the built-in bedroom cupboard.
Observations did not reveal any visual evidence of mould, damp or condensation and the author was unable to determine any musty odours and
hence, in his opinion, the flat is in good decorative order and well maintained.
In conclusion the recorded moisture readings confirm a dry structure however, likely periods of condensation noted in the thermal survey are
likely due to a lack of adequate overall ventilation in the dwelling. In regard to the tenant stating musty odours in the cupboard, this is likely due
to warm moist air entering when opened and unable to exit when closed driven by a lack of air general circulation and very little undercuts to the
doors throughout the flat. An overriding recommendation would be to emphasise the importance of adequate ventilation and changing the
internal atmosphere with drier external atmosphere and, can be aided with a compliant unit in the kitchen/lounge and adequate door undercuts
to sustain air movement through the property.
Technical Structural Health Survey Report",3
0146_FK7.pdf,"Following an inspection within the roof space it was noted the truss was clad with OSB boarding
(compliant with Scottish Building Regulations) therefore traditional ventilation methods are to be relied
on i.e. a 10mm continuous eaves and ridge ventilation rather than breather membrane felts. It was
noted that there were a couple of gable vents and 1 disused roof fan vent, although the location and air
passage are not adequate on their own to properly ventilate the attic void.
The attic floor is of non moisture resistant chip board and at the time of the survey was indicating high
moisture readings.
It was noted the attic is full to capacity with items and the temperature within this area was very cold.
Atmospheric readings were taken and recorded. It was also mentioned by Mr McKay the attached
neighboring property had the same problems only more severe and that it was clearly noticeable that
extreme mould contamination was spreading from the neighboring property and affecting Mr McKay’s
property. Due to the high atmospheric conditions and damp this is allowing mould spores to migrate
into and attach themselves to the OSB boarding of the attic.
It was also noted the eaves were heavily covered with insulation thus preventing air circulation within
the attic space.
An attic space is on average approximately 10’ warmer than the external temperature. Due to lack of
ventilation this is allowing condensation to form and provide a breeding ground for mould as noted in
section 6.1.
Moisture readings were taken throughout the property and recorded within the floor plans.
Remote monitoring devices were installed throughout and these have been recorded accordingly and
highlighted in section 6 below.
During the survey it was noted at 06.00am the bedroom windows were saturated with condensation
and that the gable walls were damp also, with condensation in particular to the front elevation which is
south facing.",1
0030_LU1.pdf,"The tenant has resided within the property for the past four years with the current issues coming to light
after the retrofit cladding was installed approximately 18months prior to our survey and, uPVC windows
with trickle vents also having been installed prior to the issues being reported.
The main concerns relate to the dampness/staining within the lounge through to bedroom 2 to the top
of the external walls (primarily survey location points D, E and F) with raised non-invasive readings
noted at these points. Drilled readings taken at location point E on the external wall gave dry levels at
depth suggesting the moisture present is likely to be on the surface possibly indicating condensation.
Water droplets were also noted to the window sill within this area likely due to condensation. Staining
continued on the same external wall through into the lounge.
From an atmospheric condition perspective, three people reside within the property with a single wash
load being processed per week mainly via a local launderette or use of the radiators to dry the items.
The bed within bedroom 1 is directly against the exterior wall and thus restricting natural airflow across
this surface allowing for cold areas to form.
A single extraction unit was noted within the kitchen which was operational but had no overrun facility,
however the unit requires cleaning. The flow rate was measured at 4.5 m/sec which when taken into
consideration with the size of the kitchen would allow for an air change every 7.3 minutes resulting in",3
0158_LU1.pdf,"At the time of the survey it was observed the property is suffering from severe condensation related
problems whereby excessive moisture droplets to the windows and ceiling of the front bedroom are
evident. The tenant explained that the property underwent a central heating change in 2012 and was
updated from an electric system to gas central heating and since that time the property has suffered
from moisture related problems.
At the time of the survey it was noted there are 4 adults and 2 children living within the 2-bed property
with the bath used every morning and night. However, the forced air extraction units within the
bathroom are blocked and not operational. The only form of ventilation within the property are small
trickle vents to the windows and these were in the open position at the time of survey.
The property had undergone works for mould contamination a year ago and the wall within the
bedroom has been insulated with therma-board, however the problem has reoccurred. It was noted
there is an obvious ventilation problem within the property and the atmospheric conditions were very
humid.
The moisture survey indicated the structure is dry and is the author’s opinion the property is suffering
significant elevated atmospheric levels with a lack of adequate ventilation. A better form of ventilation
throughout the property including fitting forced air extraction units to deal with the high moisture laden
air within the property would reduce the issues being experienced. The atmospheric conditions
indicated during the survey under protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of
condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation being classified as ‘WET’ (section 6.0).",3

Initial visit 1st Aug & 28th Sept 2023
Return visit 6th December 2023
Scope
Following instruction from ………………., attend the above property to report on current moisture
conditions and investigate the cause or causes for the reported elevated structural moisture and
associated mould growth.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a modern two-bedroom end of terrace
dwelling of cavity wall construction with a suggested
insulated concrete block and beam floor installed over a
ventilated void. Exterior walls are plasterboard lined to
the interior and plasterboard stud frame walls form the
internal partitions.
2.0 Incident:
We understand mould has been reported affecting the
skirtings and lower plasterboard wall surfaces through the
ground floor. The reported mould had been cleaned prior
to the visit and, a refrigerant dehumidifier was noted in
the lounge area but not operating.
3.0 Conclusion – 1st August 2023:
A detailed moisture survey has been carried out through the property highlighting elevated resistant pin
readings (%WME) to the plasterboard walls just above the skirtings (Section 4.1). It is the opinion of the
author this moisture is being driven by periods of elevated humidity/condensation wetting the surface
of the plasterboard at the wall/floor junction.
The survey also indicated elevated moisture to the floor screed (Section 2.2) with it noted the surface
appears to have been painted plus, the underlay has been bonded to the screed that will restrict the
evaporation of construction moisture from the floor.
A review of the ventilation provision (Section 6.1) was carried out and the system installed has
intermittent fan units in the three areas being ventilated. The systems do not meet the requirements
detailed in the building regulations ‘Approved document F 2000 – Effective from 2010’ in regard to the
flow rates of the installed fan units and the ‘Whole dwelling ventilation rate’ which should be covered by
the total open surface area of the passive ventilation.
3.1 Conclusion – 28th September 2023:
Follow up moisture readings have been recorded through the area which displayed elevated levels at
the time of the initial visit. A reduction in recorded levels was noted however, in regard to the floor slab
elevated electronic readings persist with additional readings taken where the lounge carpet has been
removed.
A sample of the floor screed to the lounge was sent for gravimetric analysis (Section 4.2.2) that indicated
a dry condition in regard to free capillary moisture and moderate levels in regard hygroscopic moisture
which would indicate a dry screed. In addition, high pH levels where noted and would suggest the
nature of the screed regard pH level hygroscopicity is influencing the electronic meter readings.
3.2 Conclusion – 6th December 2023:
A dehumidifier was operating in the lounge and, areas preciously displaying elevated readings were
resurveyed. A reduction in the wall readings was noted down to a dry condition. In regard to the floor
readings to the ground floor, elevated electronic readings were recorded however, the quantifiable
gravimetric analysis carried out on the 28th September indicated a dry condition.

4.4 Gravimetric analysis – 28th September 2023:
Floor survey location – 8:
Laboratory tests to determine levels of Total Moisture, Free Capillary and Hygroscopic Moisture where
Free Capillary moisture is moisture that has been added to the material from a source such as water
leak, ground moisture etc. Hygroscopic moisture is derived from hygroscopic salts in the building
material being wetted by the atmospheric conditions.
Total Moisture Hygroscopic Moisture Free Moisture
Material
content (%) content (%) content (%)
Concrete 3.0 % 3.2 % Nil
Where the hygroscopic moisture is in excess of the total moisture, i.e. the free moisture content is
negative, this indicates the environment within the survey area at the time the sample was removed
was less humid than the conditions used for the analysis. Such results also indicate the material was
‘dry’ (no free moisture) and the results have been recorded as 'nil.
Soluble salts and pH (water extract):

4.5 Ground floor – Floor readings – 1st August 2023:
Non-invasive readings were recorded from the floor
screed to the ground floor with readings recorded through
the vinyl flooring to the kitchen area and toilet plus close
to the back door. In the cupboard under the stairs the
carpet and underlay were lifted to allow readings to be
recorded directly from the screed.
Pictured is the understairs area to 7 Grey Way, it was
noted the screed appears to have been painted white. The
carpet underlay was bonded to the substrate with some
of the paint being lifted as the underlay was pulled back.

Based on BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings:
Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied buildings
Dry occupancy Where there is proper use of ventilation, it includes those buildings unoccupied
during the day; results in an internal vapour pressure of up to 0.3 kPa in excess of
the external vapour pressure.
Moist occupancy Where internal humidities are above normal; likely to have poor ventilation;
possibly a family with children, water vapour pressure excess is between 0.3 kPa
and 0.6 kPa
Wet occupancy Wet occupancy: ventilation hardly ever used; high moisture generation; probably
a family with young children, water vapour pressure excess is greater
than 0.6 kPa
5.0 Thermal survey:
5.1 Number 5 – Base of kitchen wall – 15:00:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface
temperature within this survey area was 23.6⁰C and
the calculated dew point temperature was 16.8⁰C.
Condensation was not an issue at the time of the
survey.
Base of the exterior kitchen wall was 25.3⁰C.
6.0 Observations and relevant information:
6.1 Ventilation:
Ventilation calculations are based on a floor area of 79m2 plus 2 bedrooms.
6.1.1 Passive ventilation:
Trickle vents were noted with a total equivalent area for the property of 16000mm2.
6.1.2 Forced ventilation:
Intermittent functioning fan units were noted in the bathrooms, kitchen areas and ground floor toilet
with the following flow rates recorded:
Property Area Flow rate Over-run Control
Bathroom 12.9 l/s 10 minutes Light function
5 Kitchen 21.6 l/s Manual switch
Toilet 13.8 l/s 2.5 minutes Light function
6.1.3 Make-up air flow into the Bathroom:
To ensure extractor fan units are effective, make-up air must be able to flow freely into the ventilated
area plus, undercuts to all the doors through the property are required to allow the free flow of
background ventilation. To this end Part F of the Building Regulations requires a gap of 10mm. A review
of the internal doors suggested in general they meet the requirement.
6.1.4 Fan flow rates requirements:
Regarding forced ventilation in the properties, intermittent fan units were noted in the bathroom,
kitchen area and toilet.
Building regulations indicate the following flow rates are required as detailed in - Approved document F
2000 – Effective from 2010. It should be noted this standard has been updated to Approved document F
2010 – Effective from 15th June 2022.
Approved document F – 2000:
Intermittent fan units:
Required boost function flow rates.
Bathroom 15 Litres/second
Kitchen 30 Litres/second adjacent to the hob.
60 Litres/Second elsewhere
Toilet 6 Litres/Second
In addition to ventilating the kitchen, bathrooms and toilet, there is also a requirement to achieve the
‘Whole dwelling ventilation rate’. In the case of intermittent fan units this is achieved by the natural
ventilation through the trickle vents etc. In the case of the surveyed property the total open surface area
of the passive ventilation should be at least 35000mm2 with this level specified for properties leakier
than 5m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa. It has been calculated on the floor area and number of bedrooms.
Continuous running fans with boost function:
Required boost function flow rates.
Bathroom 8 Litres/second
Kitchen 13 Litres/second
Toilet 6 Litres/second
In the case of continuous running fans with boost function this is covered by the continuous running
rate of the installed fan units combined. Which in regard to the surveyed property is 23.7 Litres/Sec base
on the floor area or number of bedrooms whatever is the greater.
6.2 Mould activity:
The main driver which allows moulds to develop and flourish in and on the materials within a structure
is moisture or, to be precise, water activity. Materials can become damp in a number of ways, directly
being wetted, moisture penetrating materials through capillary action, physical contact and hygroscopic
materials absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere.
There are many hundreds of mould varieties each requiring different levels of water activity to allow
them to develop and flourish. The lowest known level of water activity at which mould can be active is
0.61. In general, this level collates to an atmospheric relative humidity (RH) of 61%. Condensation does
not have to form on the surface. For there to be sufficient moisture to allow mould to become
established at the point where condensation occurs, the relative humidity will be 100%.
Moulds are simple fungi from several groupings in the fungal classification system. Sexual reproduction
in some fungi allows genetic modification to adapt and tolerate changes in the environment such as
humidity, temperature, and food requirements.
There are three principal features common to the broad range of mould:
1. Simple food requirements: able to exist on non-nutrient materials such as plaster and brick
which have traces of contaminating organic matter.
2. Produce vast number of spores which allow rapid adaptation to particular environments
conditions and rapid colonization of other suitable locations within an enclosed environment.
3. Grow very quickly under suitable conditions. The main requirement for the development and
growth is a source of moisture although food, oxygen and a suitable temperature are also
important.
Moulds can be regarded as hydrophilic fungi (tolerating high water availability) although individual
species have their own optimum requirements for moisture. In most situations where surface
condensation occurs and or the relative humidity of the internal atmosphere exceeds 70% (0.7 aw) for
an extended period, mould growth will be established.
Mould is opportunist and once established in a property will quickly colonize areas with appropriate
conditions. Most properties through their normal occupational cycle will have periods of high
occupational moisture however, it is the prolonged periods which will allow mould to develop. Once
mould is present in a structure the period of time it will take to colonize new areas is reduced due to
the increased level of spores being produced in an enclosed area. In many cases a process of mould
removal is required to allow a satisfactory outcome to change in occupational activity when trying to
prevent further mould activity.

0057_NW6.pdf,"Upon arrival we were advised of concerns immediately
linked to the detection of damp related odours. This was not readily evident to the author and, is my
opinion the only odours being witnessed could likely relate to stale air as the property has not been
occupied for a period of time plus, all internal doors were closed as were the trickle vents noted to all
windows.
The resident and her representative showed images of previous mould in areas however, no mould was
evident at the time of the survey due to the entire location being redecorated.
Prior to any checks being made, it was noted there was a significant amount of contents being stored in
each room and, the loft was a particular area of concern as no access was possible due to the amount of
items being stored in this area (section ) with the residents representative suggesting the cases in this loft
were his.
To help determine if there were immediate concerns in areas, a limited moisture profile due to the
significant contents being stored was conducted of areas to the ground floor with no elevated moisture
readings recorded and, would suggest the building fabric was dry at the time in regard to any potential
ingress related issues.
An inspection of the floor void was undertaken in three areas to aid understanding the void condition and
any presence of significant mould that could be affecting the internal atmosphere. Access points were
made to the under-stairs cupboard, the dining room and the hallway with no immediate concerns noted
(section ). Where accessible, moisture levels of the timbers were checked and, they did not give any rise
for concern. The void base did not display any standing water and was considered to be dry at the time.
To the exterior there were two air bricks to the front bay window and a single air brick located beneath
the dining window to the rear RH side. With a solid floor kitchen extension, there remains a likelihood
some airbricks to the rear have now been compromised.
An assessment of all ventilation measures was undertaken with forced extractors noted in the kitchen and
bathroom. On test the bathroom device delivered the required flow rate in Boost mode however the
kitchen unit was below that recommended for an intermittent device located away from a cooker (section
6.7).
From a passive perspective, trickle vents were fitted to all windows with two in each opening aspect. At
the time only 2 out of 15 trickle vents were open and would likely coincide with the property being void
for a period of time.
As indicated, at the time there was no clear evidence of mould on the building fabric however, there was
wall picture handed to the author that displayed mould spots to the rear. Mould on contents items is
related to atmospheric management and not a damp structure hence, it is likely to have been impacted
when the property displayed mould in areas.
Other images displayed to the author showed mould in upper corners of room that, with a thermal survey
not suggesting immediate concerns, will likely be aligned to inadequate ventilation when the property
was occupied.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, with a dry structure and a lack of air circulation during non-
occupancy, the likely result is ‘stale’ and ‘stagnant’ atmospheric conditions witnessed by persons entering
the property after a period of time. Ideally the property will need to be occupied in order to assess the
ventilation adequacy and their use. In addition, it is a recommendation the loft is dealt with in order an
assessment can be made of the ability for it to naturally ventilate that if restricted, can lead to mould and
rotting timbers which was not evident at the time.",3
0130_CT9.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey (Section 4.0) was carried out across the front elevation to the two first floor
rooms.
Raised moisture levels were indicated in a number of areas however, it is the opinion of the author
condensation is a factor in the moisture levels indicated.
Invasive readings taken did indicate significant moisture levels at depth into the wall structure to the
right hand side of the wall structure as viewed from the front of the property (Section 6.1).
The exterior of the wall structure was inspected and this failed to identify any significant areas of failure
in relation to the external render system (Section 6.3).
Wall temperature and atmospheric moisture levels were a factor at the time of the survey and sufficient
water activity was present in relation to the surveyed wall structures to sustain mould activity.",1
0267_TA8.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.3) indicated in general that with the exception of the predominantly
north-west facing wall in the bedroom, the wall structures displayed dry readings. Raised moisture
readings were however indicated with regard to resistance readings recorded to the base of the walls in
the affected areas at survey points A to F within the bedroom area and the supporting thermal survey
(Section 5.0) showed condensation was an issue at the time of the survey in these locations. Drilled
moisture readings made into the cavity wall to the loss affected area of the bedroom suggested the DPC
to the wall structure was not compromised (Section 7.2 & 4.4).
Issues with the ventilation of the property were noted, mainly the fact the kitchen does not have an
extractor fan unit installed (Section 6.3). Passive vents have been installed in addition to the trickle vents
to the windows, which in general were closed at the time of the survey. Over-ventilation of a property
can prove to be counterproductive as it can greatly affect the tenant’s ability to control air and surface
temperatures in the property.
It was noted the three large air bricks have been introduced to ventilate the wall cavity to the bedroom
area (Section 7.3). This will have the effect of greatly reducing the temperature of the internal leaf of the
cavity wall across the loss affected wall structure and, reducing the wall temperature will have the effect
of increasing the frequency of times when condensation will affect the internal wall surfaces through
this area. Observations to the exterior indicated cavity wall insulation has been installed however the
invasive survey of the cavity suggested the cavity fill is sparse (Section 7.2).
It is the opinion of the authors the introduced ventilation of the cavity to the loss affected wall to the
bedroom may well be a contributory factor to the issues being experienced (Section 7.3).
It is also the opinion of the authors that several factors are contributing to the effects on the north-west
facing bedroom wall in this property, primarily due to moisture loading within a small property.
 The bathroom has an extractor fan operated by the tenant via a pull cord and not linked to the
light function. The unit is not extracting the air as effectively as guidance would recommend and
also does not have sufficient overrun (Section 6.2).
 There is no extractor fan fitted in the kitchen (Section 6.3).",1
0166_ME15.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the access points already cut through the ceiling
structure to the rear bedroom and landing areas (Section 4.0). In both cases a dry condition was noted
with regard to the timber structure.
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) combined with the noted atmospheric conditions (Section 4.1)
indicated condensation was not occurring with regard to the surveyed structure.
The asphalted flat roof structure is shared with the adjoining properties and the author was unaware of
issues affecting the adjoining properties (Section 7.2). It was reported by the home owner the issues first
started to be noted during the cold periods of the winter months.
Issues with the ventilation were noted to both the bathroom and en-suite areas to the top floor (Section
6.0) and these would lead to raised atmospheric levels in the property.
It is opinion of the author the issues being experienced are being driven by interstitial condensation and,
opening the ceiling structures has had the effect of increasing the temperatures in the roof area
alleviating the conditions.",1
0135_DT5.pdf,"The main area of mould is affecting the master bedroom however it was noted in other areas and the
tenants are reported having to clean the affected areas to the walls and ceiling on a regular basis. The
moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure however issues were noted with the control of
the forced ventilation to the bathroom (Section 6.2.1) which would encourage raised humidity levels in
the property. Issues were highlighted with the loft insulation at the property (Section 5.3) and will
encourage colder surfaces during the winter months. Cold surfaces will in turn produce raised relative
humidity levels in the atmosphere adjacent to the cold surface that will encourage mould activity. Based
on the observations made at the property it is the opinion of the author the main driver for the mould
activity is atmospheric moisture levels being generated through occupational activity and ineffective
ventilation.",3
0152_HA4.pdf,"Tests conducted confirmed none of the internal pipework is leaking.
The foul drain outside the kitchen was found to be leaking.
The storm drain on the party wall was found to be leaking and blocked.
An invasive excavation into the floor structure identified multiple wet layers.",0
0254_TA6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.3) indicated that in general the wall structures displayed dry readings
with areas of slightly elevated readings in several places at the time of the visit to the property. Though
mould was present at low level in the living room (locations Q, R, S and T, see Section 6.1) and in the
outside facing walls of the utility (Section 6.3), readings in these areas did not indicate moisture levels of
concern. Nevertheless, coincidental penetrations from outside through into the living room walls at the
location of the mould were noted (See section 6.4), though with no indication of moisture, is not
considered to be contributing to the mould.
In general raised internal atmospheric moisture levels in properties are the main driver for damp and
mould related issues affecting structures. Although based on BS 5250:2002 (Code of practice for control
of condensation in buildings) the current occupation would be considered to be dry at the time of the
survey (Section 4.5), it was noted the forced fan air extraction in the kitchen is working below
recommended extraction rates (Section 5.4) and there is no functional extraction in the bathroom
(Section 5.5). Further, the lack of a door between the kitchen and utility means that moisture generated
in the kitchen will use this additional room space to reach a state of equilibrium, meaning the
atmospheric moisture load in the utility rises and in its current configuration, the extractor fan will need
to run for over an hour to undertake one air change of these combined rooms (Section 5.4).
The trickle vents were mostly not in use at the time of the survey (section 5.1) whilst the external
passive vents were in a poor state of repair (Section 5.3). There is no discernable air flow through the
passive air vents systems.",3
0109_BS26.pdf,"The occupant is the only person living at the property and we are advised approx. three washing loads
are processed per week and the washing is often left to dry indoors due to the current weather
conditions. During the survey it was noted the extractor in the bathroom was not operating and all
trickle vents were closed. With items being dried in the bathroom at the time of the survey, the above
issues can lead to instances of elevated internal atmospheric conditions.
A moisture survey of the property indicated the structure in general to be dry however thermal images
clearly show the walls and roof void have been insulated however the sloped internal sections of the
ceiling do not appear to be insulated. This will lead to a definitive cold band around the top of the walls
and, with increased internal atmospheric conditions, has likely resulted in the current mould growth
observed in these locations.
We also observed the WC in the wet room appears to have a point of moisture ingress around the base
of the pedestal, lifting or bubbling of the lino would also support this observation.",3
0289_TW18.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated raised structural moisture levels through many of the
external wall structures to the original areas of the property however in general, dry readings were
indicated to the internal walls and the walls to the extension. The DPC to the original wall structures was
identified (Section 7.1) and observations suggested this is compromised by the external render systems
applied (Section 7.3). It was confirmed the flood water did not affect the walls above the level of the
DPC through the original areas and if loss water was able to bypass the DPC, ground water will also be
affecting the upper wall structures. It may well be the case the significantly raised hydrostatic pressure
applied to the structure during the flood has amplified the noted bridging issues. It is recommended the
noted issues with the render systems should be addressed before the upper wall structures can be
successfully dried.
With regard to the restorative drying, the moisture survey suggested levels in areas not affected by the
render are, in general, now down to acceptable levels (Section 7.4).
In many cases raised humidity levels in properties will sustain mould activity and moulds which became
established in properties during the loss event if not effectively remediated, can still be sustained by the
atmospheric conditions after the property is re-occupied (Section 7.5).",0
0007_CM9.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out through the property (Section 4.0) and clearly indicated
a dry structure to the walls. Regarding the floor structure elevated moisture readings were noted in a
number of areas:
 Kitchen floor – non-invasive readings recorded through the resilient flooring, likely due to the
suggested age of the structure the original floor finish may well be acting as the DPM in which
case elevated readings would be expected.
 Timber floor to bedroom 1 – resistance pin readings and observations would suggest interstitial
condensation occurring under the carpet may well be a driver for the recorded moisture.
The noted damp to the floor structures would not be a driver for the reported mould.
Regarding ventilation, it was noted the property does not benefit from forced ventilation in either the
bathroom or kitchen with the dwelling totally reliant on passive ventilation. Observations strongly point
to persistent elevated atmospheric moisture levels being the driver for the reported mould activity plus
the mould noted to be affecting the contents. The tenant also highlighted issues regarding draughts
associated with the front and rear doors to the property (Section 6.5).",1
0170_ME3.pdf,"Possible ACM’s noted in the property:
 Artex to wall structures through a number areas in the property and affected by the areas of
structural damp.
Moisture related issues through the property:
The moisture survey undertaken (Section 5.0) indicated areas of significant structural moisture to both
ground floor and first floor areas. With regarded to first floor areas rain water ingress the through issues
with the exterior render was suggested (Section 8.3). Moisture levels affecting the ground floor wall
structures would tend to suggest a plumbing issue affecting the structure, a reasonable minor issues was
identified with regard to the bath waste (Section 8.2). It is the opinion of the author this is not the only
source of moisture affecting the structure, further plumbing checks area recommended.
Atmospheric moisture conditions, with regard to forced ventilation the kitchen extractor is reported not
to work and has been covered with a wall unit during up grading of the kitchen units (Section 7.2.1). The
bathroom extractor was shown not to have sufficient over run to effectively clear damp air to the
exterior (Section 7.2.2).
Mould activity was noted in the property likely to be driven by raised atmospheric moisture levels,
occupational activity combined with ineffective ventilation will be significant driver for internal
atmospheric conditions.",1
0181_N8.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in general the window and patio door reveals through the
property were dry however there were a number of areas where raised moisture levels were indicated.
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) indicated condensation in these highlighted areas was a likely cause for
the raised moisture levels indicated.
Issues were identified with regard to the forced ventilation of the en-suite and bathroom areas through
the property.
It is the opinion of the author the reported issues are in general being driven by elevated internal
atmospheric moisture levels which in the main will be driven by occupational activity.",1
0171_ME4.pdf,"On arrival, the boiler was showing zero pressure on the gauge but once re-pressurized, no drop occurred
during the survey. The heating pipes extending from the boiler down and along into bedroom 1 were
visually checked with no defects noted. The bed and a section of carpet was taken back in bedroom 1 in
the area where we are advised it becomes wet and whilst there were signs of what appears to be water
staining, no raised moisture levels recorded. However, in this location condensation was an issue.
We are advised by the tenant there are 14 washing loads processed per week and dried either outside in
the summer months or, on radiators/airers.
With regard to existing ventilation measures, the majority of the windows were closed with curtains
pulled at the time of our survey and there are no trickle vents noted through the property. There is no
extraction unit in the kitchen and the area does not benefit from a door isolating this location from the
remainder of the property.
Two extraction units were observed however with one in the bathroom and one in the WC which at the
time of our survey, was not working. The unit in the bathroom operates via the light switch but at the
time, had to switch on the isolator in order to operate the unit.
On test the extraction unit in the bathroom recorded a flow rate of 0.4 m/s which equates to 3.4 m/s
and is below the current recommended building regs flow rate of 15 l/s with a 15 minute overrun. Both
extraction units are in a poor condition and also the author cannot confirm where the units extract to as
external observations did not readily reveal any exit vent points.
Mould and condensation was evident at the time of our survey with outbreaks on external walls in the
lounge and bedroom 1 as well as on a number of the window frames and the stair handrail. At the time
of our survey there was no evidence of mould to the bathroom, WC and bedroom 2.
It was observed that a number of contents were against the external walls in areas and will restrict the
natural airflow and circulation causing a build-up of cold spots potentially leading to condensation.
A detailed moisture survey throughout the property revealed the structure to be dry and in conclusion,
it is the opinion of the author the likely cause for the mould and condensation outbreaks are due to a
combination of a lack of adequate ventilation through the property, and occupational activities including
stored contents against exterior walls and drying clothes within the fabric of the building which itself
adds a significant moisture load within the property.",3
0003_BR1.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised of concerns mainly to areas of the reveals through habitable rooms
however, at the time of the survey, all areas did not display mould and had been treated prior to the
survey.
A limited moisture profile conducted through the property indicated a dry building fabric. However,
elevated readings were noted to the external door reveals in the lounge area at low level.
Suffice to add, this was the area of concern to the occupants concerning the floor integrity as it was
moving up and down when stepped on possibly suggesting a localized issue.
In support of the above, an external assessment of this area readily showed gaps in the render finish and
sealant at low level that would enable free water ingress.
An excavation of the area close to the window reveal walls, also indicated a clear gap between the
installed paving and the property itself (section 6.3). In addition, a gap was also observed with a borescope
between the lower brick wall and the floor construction which could enable rainwater to pool in this
location running off the high level patio paving potentially leading to the localized internal wet reveal
areas and the spongy internal floor with it recommended this area is reassessed for construction
effectivity concerning penetrating damp with a French drain considered in place of the open plastic
elements currently installed.
Regarding ventilation adequacy in the property which could be contributing to the previous reported
mould, not all the windows had trickle vents fitted likely aligned to mould in reveals and, a forced extractor
was observed in both the open-plan kitchen/lounge and bathroom.
On test both extractor devices did not appear to comply with the current regulations and, no contributory
mechanisms were noted apart from a single switch in the cupboard to power both devices in a constant
running format.
In support of extraction efficiency the door undercuts were also noted to be less than the recommended
10mm gap between the door underside and floor finish to aid air circulation and resultant extractor
performance by drawing air from the property as a whole to aid extracting generated moist air.
A thermal assessment did not suggest any issues that could contribute to the reported mould however, a
separate issue was noted in the bathroom ceiling that could align to a possible leak from the property
above (section 5.1).
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, the problems advised by the occupants are likely due to an
absence of ventilation adequacy aligned to the limited trickle vents plus installed extractors and their
compliance with existing regulatory measures. In addition inadequate door undercuts can restrict the
ability of extractor performance leading to more open doors to clear generated moist air in turn enabling
warm moist air to travel the property due to vapour pressure differential leading to mould in the
mentioned areas when it comes into contact with colder surfaces where air circulation is restricted.
At the time, measured atmospheric conditions confirmed a clear difference between the interior and
exterior suggesting periods of retained warm air.
On a separate note, consideration should be given to the likely ability for rainwater to penetrate the
external door area in the lounge leading to the recorded damp in the lower wall reveals and possibly the
spongy floor finish (section 6.3). It is recommended this area is assessed for building compliance, reduced
water entry and damaged render and sealant supported by clear gaps between the render finish and
sealant to the sill (section 6.5). In addition, the open areas between the patio and wall with an additional
gap between the lower wall and floor that could well align with the spongy feel (section 6.4 & 6.4.1).",1
0016_DA16.pdf,A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section,0
0169_ME2.pdf,"Mould activity was noted on every external wall and around windows throughout the property and this
has migrated to ceiling areas.
There are two passive vents per bedroom some of which were closed at time of visit and being covered
up by curtains thus restricting airflow.
Our moisture survey confirms the structure to be dry in most areas. The mould noted at time of visit, is
likely caused by condensation which occurs due to a lack of ventilation and occupational activity.
High moisture readings were recorded on the external wall in bedroom 1 just below the balcony of the
flat above. A number of major cracks to the external render throughout the entire block were noted,
one of which is directly in line with the area of high moisture readings and is the likely cause of the issue
in this area.",3
0300_CH7.pdf,"A survey was conducted through the property and, the issues experienced are, in the opinion of the author, a direct result of atmospheric
moisture and inadequate ventilation.
With a dry structure, the following is therefore recommended:
Upgrade the EnviroVent Filterless fan internal cartridges in the Kitchen, Bathroom and Shower Room with new Infinity 8 cartridges to allow fine
tuning of the whole dwelling ventilation rate to meet at least 40 l/s.
Kitchen fan. Remove the rear 100mm spigot and fit a 150mm liner to atmosphere.
Replace the Utility Room fan with a new EnviroVent Infinity 8 extract fan and include the setting in the whole dwelling ventilation rate. Ideally the
tumble drier should be ducted to atmosphere and could be achieved by flat ducting 204 x 60, running across the top of the wall units in the utility
room. It may however, require some sacrifice of wall unit space directly above the tumble drier.
Close the trickle vents in the Kitchen, Bathroom and Shower Room.
Remove the Positive Input Ventilation unit and make good based on the lack of fire damper, mixing ventilation systems and compliance with the
current Building Regulations.
Technical Structural Health Survey Report",3
0108_BS24.pdf,"The original construction of this building appeared to incorporate solid concrete lintels to all
walls. I was unable to determine the exact construction of these lintols, but I assume that these
either have cavity trays installed above them or are cast with a cavity tray in the design.
Solid concrete lintols will cause severe cold spots to the inside walls and these will become far
more prevalent when the rest of the walls have been insulated with cavity wall insulation i.e. the
temperature differential between insulated walls and cold concrete lintels could be substantial.
The mould prevalent in this property appears to be the common black mould Cladosporium
Herbarum. It is a common fungal plant pathogen often found in occupied properties that have
poor ventilation and subsequent high atmospheric moisture levels. This gives rise to
condensation on those parts of the internal structure that are at or below dew point, relevant to
the temperature and humidity that exists in the building. In this case the concrete lintels are the
coldest areas and this is where the mould is greatest. Cladosporium Herbarum has a root
system that needs to be killed off with multiple applications of a biocide. We recommend that
mould remediation works are carried out by a specialist company that will give a guarantee to
clear the property. Ideally these works should be carried out when the property is vacant.
My investigations did not reveal any areas of visible moisture on the surface at any point
throughout the building, but the wall temperatures where not all below dew point at the time of
my survey. However wall temperatures at the site of the worst areas of black mould where at or
below dew point, so condensation would be beginning to form at these sites. I am of the opinion
that there will be times when moisture is visible on the walls when the external temperature is
very low.
Whilst the surfaces of walls were dry, REL readings showed that there was water beneath the
surface within the inner skin of cavity block wall. I'm of the opinion that whilst recent works
have ventilated the property to a better standard, it is likely that as problems with the cavity wall
insulation have existed for many years moisture levels will have built up inside the inner skin.
The only way to reduce this will be to remove the cavity wall insulation and dry out the walls
using warmed desiccated Air injected under pressure into the cavity, otherwise it will take
several seasons to dry and mould might reoccur in the interim.
On arrival I noted that most windows were open throughout the property. I closed the windows
(trickle vents were left open) and left them closed for approximately 1 1/2 hours before taking
any atmospheric readings. After this period the specific humidity internally averaged at 9.10
g/KG, but peaking at 9.4 g/KG. The external specific humidity ranged from 6.06 to 6.70.
Surface temperatures of the walls in the property downstairs where the mould is worse were as
follows.
 On mould in corner of dining room rear wall 12.8°C
 middle of the wall in dining room rear 16.6°C
 internal wall between lounge and dining room 15.8°C
 middle of external wall in lounge 16.1°C
 on mould area in corner of lounge by sofa bed 10.3°C
 above sofa bed mid wall 15.0°C
You will see from the Structural moisture readings at 6.4 below that whilst there were high REL
readings the WME surface readings were in fact all in the lower region. From this I would
determine that the problems being experienced within this property is related to atmospheric
moisture condensing out onto the structure where it is feeding the black mould.
This survey has been carried out only after a number of solutions have been tried to prevent
mould growth, but unfortunately the efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Whilst there are
quite a number of areas where there is clearly moisture within the cavity and the internal skin of
blockwork, it is my impression that this moisture has got into the walls from 2 sources.
1) There has clearly been a long standing issue with this property having poor ventilation
predominantly in the kitchen and bathroom areas where the majority of occupational
moisture is generated. However there is also an issue with the roof void which is
unventilated, but insulated to a very high standard. However the roof has not been
separated from the main living compartment with a vapour impermeable barrier.
Therefore moisture vapour can pass up through the ceiling through the insulation and
when it meets the cold unventilated void above the insulation moisture vapour builds up
eventually condenses out of suspension within the roof void when the dew point is
reached, but being a cold void it will attract a lot of moisture.
During the night the condensation can run down the walls, but by day when the sun shines on the
roof and the roof void warms up, the moisture will evaporate into vapour inside the roof void and
pass down into the living compartment. However a positive pressure air unit has been installed
so this will actually pump the moist stale air back down into the living compartment. I therefore
recommend that this unit is removed. In my view this should not have been fitted as a solution to
overcome the problems in this property. Without adequate cross flow ventilation within the roof
void to dissipate any moisture permeating into the cold roof void a positive pressure unit could in
my view in this case be detrimental to this property as it will recirculate moisture back and forth
between the roof and living compartment storing up moisture. When parts of the structure in
either area are at or below Dew Point (DP) for the Relative Humidity (RH) present then
condensation will occur and that could be in the living compartment or in the roof void,
dependant upon air temperatures and the RH. The effect of this would be for the structure to be
like a battery being charged, only in this instance it is being charged with moisture from
interstitial condensation within the internal skin of the property.
I examined the cavity wall insulation in four different areas and found that it had blown fibre and
a very low density with voids present. Low density cavity wall insulation has very little thermal
insulation value to the property, but the installation blocks air movement within the cavity which
effectively becomes a poorly insulated unventilated sealed void. Moisture vapour will be
attracted to all areas where there are cold voids and if the surface is vapour permeable moisture
vapour will pass into the wall and if the temperature of that wall is at or below DP interstitial
condensation will occur within the wall. The only wet area of CWI I could find was where the
roof was leaking. However there are likely to be other areas within the whole property as I could
clearly not conceivably drill every single spot.
As the CWI is a very poor density I would recommend that it is all removed from the property so
that the cavity can be dried out, particularly the internal skin to allow it to be re-insulated
properly. I would recommend that any insulation is installed by qualified installers who have
carried out a thorough survey of the property and are willing to guarantee this with a CIGA 25

The presence of the large tree on the corner is dominating the property and in my opinion is
causing problems for this structure. This should be pruned, topped and regularly managed or
alternatively removed completely.
There is a 100% WME and REL 999 in the plaster below the vent axia fitted to the kitchen wall.
This is indicative of water leaking in via the outside wall or condensation occurring in the
ducting, which is leaking back into the wall. However it should also be noted that this was the
site of the old boiler (recently replaced) and this might be associated with a fault on the former
installation. Further investigation and remedial works required to sort this out.
A crack was noted in the rear wall beneath the window. This appears to be an old crack and was
probably due to residual settlement after construction or a period of localised softening that has
now settled down. There was no evidence of settlement cracking showing internally so it is
assumed that this has been filled at some point when decorations have been carried out. I assume
that records will have been kept of this, but if there is any doubt over this being historic I suggest
that the crack is monitored for ongoing movement over a period exceeding six months.",1
0125_CR0.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant structural moisture levels in a number of areas
through the property. With regard to areas of raised structural moisture these mainly affected external
walls to the property and in general where cracking and failure of the external render systems were an
issue (Section 6.3). Salts analysis in regard to the areas of failed wall finishes to the kitchen areas
suggested a ground water issue as well as penetrating damp (Section 6.2). A number of other areas of
concern were noted with regard to the external envelope which are detailed in the report. With regard
to the front porch to the property significant movement of the structure has occurred (Section 6.8).
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) showed condensation was not an issue in the property at the time of
the survey. However, issues with the effectiveness of the forced ventilation in both the bathroom and
kitchen were noted (Section 6.1.2).",1
0096_BH12.pdf,"The moisture survey carried out through both properties showed a significant area of both was affected
by the loss (Section 4.0). Checks carried out with regard to the plumbed systems to both flats suggested
plumbing leaks are not the cause of the issues being experienced (Section 5.1).
Water testes carried out in both flats identified significant leaks with regard to bath and shower seals
plus de-bonded tiling and failure of grouting allowing loss water to migrate into the structure (Section
5.2).",0
0262_TA6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.3) indicated in general the wall structures displayed dry readings with
areas of isolated interest in bedroom 2, living room, kitchen and bathroom. Extensive mould in the
property suggests likely previous high atmospheric moisture loading.
The investigation revealed slightly elevated readings in a number of locations including the walls and
ceiling in bedroom 2 at locations G and H (Section 6.1 & 6.2), the skirting at location K (Section 6.3) close
to where a satellite cable enters the room (Section 6.4), locations K and L where the corresponding
external slab is displaying cracking (Section 6.5) and location M in the living room just inside the
doorway to the veranda where a cracked concrete junction visible on the veranda supports the floor
above (Section 6.6). The pillar is boarded internally covering the joint between it and the brick wall
(Section 6.7). With surrounding walls and ceiling showing dry readings, the elevated readings in the
skirting to the west wall suggest the junction on the wall and pillar requires an external investigation to
rule out any possible ingress issue.
The walls and floor surrounding the bathroom sink and toilet provided the most elevated moisture
reading indications in the property (locations U, V and W). Pipework at low level is noted with the water
and gas supply piping entering the property behind and below the cistern. No pipework, including the
waste pipes, were showing signs of leaking at the time of the survey, though some were heavily covered
in mould likely suggesting previous instances of condensation as being a likely cause.
With no functioning electricity, the performance of a forced fan for air extraction in the bathroom (with
no windows) could not be determined, though a pull-chord switch for operation was noted. The vent
above the bath is in need of a thorough clean (Section 5.3) suggesting previous air movement through it,
though its effective expelling to the exterior could not be confirmed.
The extraction effectiveness and flow rate of the forced fan fitted in the kitchen as well as its method of
operation, could also not be determined in the absence of electricity and a manual switch near the
location of the cooker was noted. The external vent plate located on the veranda needs of a thorough
clean.
Mould is present throughout the property and will reoccur if not remediated effectively with a fungicidal
treatment to eradicate the root system prior to any redecoration.
Some of the original floor tiles in the hall are cracked and broken (Section 6.8). Though not considered
to be a trip hazard these need to be assessed for potential asbestos and repair.",1

Scope
Following instruction from…………………, attend the above property to undertake a damp and mould
survey, with regard to reported water ingress affecting the bedroom and lounge area.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a two bedroom flat on the 16th floor of a
17 storey block circa 1960s of concrete frame construction
with cavity brick external walls. Solid concrete floors and
ceilings and internal block work walls are noted.
2.0 Incident:
The tenant moved into the flat in 1996 and advises there
has always been an issue of water ingress from above
affecting the ceiling in bedroom 1 and the lounge. We are
advised that within the last year or so, works have been
carried out to the balcony above which at present, has
resulted in no further ingress to the ceiling in the lounge
however, there remains a reported issue affecting the loss
area to the ceiling in bedroom 1 plus an additional small
area adjacent to the window to bedroom 1. No other
issues were reported by the tenant.
3.0 Conclusion – 10th March:
The moisture survey undertaken showed in general a dry structure through the reported loss areas.
However, raised levels were noted to a localised area to the ceiling in bedroom 1.
Observations made during the thermal survey would
possibly suggest the area of concern may well fall under
the exterior wall to the structure above rather than the
balcony area itself.
To allow a clear understanding as to how the suggested
ingress is migrating down and affecting the ceiling, an
inspection of the flat above is recommended.
3.1 Conclusion following visit to balcony area to flat 67:
The following observations were made:
 The loss area to flat 65 is located just inside the footprint of flat 67 in an area associated with
the window opening in the uPVC wall and frame forming the exterior of flat 67 (Section 6.1).
 Observations would possibly suggest the original wall structure was brick cavity with the current
wall structure being installed during refurbishment works, however this should be confirmed
(Section 6.4).
 Measurements taken and water ingress via the uPVC wall structure and possibly the detailing
with adjoining structures may well be a route of water ingress.
Recommendations:
 If possible the as-built detail of the exterior wall to flat 67 should be confirmed.
 Once the wall structure is understood it is suggested the internal boxing and possible uPVC
flashings are removed to allow access to the lower detail and water testing should be carried
out at this time to confirm if possible, the route of ingress.
 Trades should be in attendance at the time of the invasive investigation to allow remedial works
to be carried out at the same time if possible.

5.0 Observations:
Flat 65 – 10th March:
5.1 Ventilation:
The property was well ventilated at the time of the survey with windows and trickle vents open and
continuous background forced ventilation of the bathroom, toilet and kitchen areas.
5.2 Damage to ceiling decoration – survey location 7:
A clear area of decorative paint damage to the ceiling in bedroom 1 was noted which was reported by
the tenant to be the location where water ingress has always been an issue. Size of damage is approx.
1.2 square meters.
5.3 Additional area to bedroom 1:
Slight water staining is noted just above the window
which we are advised by the tenant is a new area of water
ingress and is in the area of survey locations 5 – 9 where
dry conditions were noted.
5.4 Thermal survey:
5.4.1 Lounge ceiling:
Pictured is the lounge ceiling and the cold area to the ceiling outlining the balcony area above is clearly
evident. The same detail was noted to the ceiling of bedroom 1.
5.4.2 Bedroom 1 ceiling:
It was observed the loss area to the ceiling in the bedroom falls to the
rear of the balcony area above, possibly not under the balcony area but
under the wall structure to the flat above.
6.0 Observations - Balcony area to flat 67 – 6th May:
6.1 External balcony:
As requested the external balcony area was assessed and
showed the external walls to the penthouse apartment
above the loss affected area to flat 65 is a uPVC framed
structure which the leaseholder in flat 67 believes was
installed when the flat was refurbished prior to him
moving in. Measurements showed the external face of
the uPVC frame is 1000mm from the back side of the
parapet wall. Measurements recorded at the time of the
initial visit to flat 65 showed the center of the loss area to
be approximately 1250mm back from the external wall.
The measurements suggest the ingress location sits just
inside the footprint of flat 67 associated with the uPVC wall structure. Measurements taken from the
flank wall to flat 65 position the loss area under the left hand side opening window as viewed of the
exterior of the bedroom to flat 67.
6.2 Water ingress into window frame:
Observations made suggested rainwater migrates past
the seals into the associated window frame. Water
testing was carried out which showed water entering the
frame drains down through the uPVC wall structure to
the lower sill at the base of the wall where it drains out
of the wall over the lower sill onto the deck.
6.3 Base of wall structure:
The uPVC wall sits on a lower solid plinth which formed
the rear edge of the balcony which the deck membrane is
dressed. A flashing detail was noted secured under the
uPVC sill and dressed down over the plinth and dressed
membrane.
Water from the testing can been seen on the deck where
it has drained from the wall structure.
6.4 Original exterior wall structures:
Reported information indicates the current uPVC exterior
walls area a reasonably recent addition of the structure
and a review of the adjoining areas would possibly
suggest brick cavity walls once formed the exterior walls
to the surveyed property. Ideally this should be
confirmed to allow a clearer understanding of the
structure.
6.5 Suggested wall structure:
UPVC Wall and lower sill
Membrane to balcony dressed up under
flashing detail
Internal MDF boxing over base of wall and
heating pipes
Heating pipes
Possible remaining section of original
exterior wall
Concrete slab forming ceiling to flat 65
6.6 Internal area:
Picture is the internal area to flat 67 above the loss
affected area indicated in flat 65. Moisture readings taken
through the decorative floor indicated a dry condition with
regard to the decorative flooring and MDF boxing. A small
access hole was made in the boxing with the permission of
the leaseholder and a review made with a survey camera
identified the heating pipes secured to what appeared to
be an original wall structure now covered by the MDF
boxing.
With regard to the water ingress affecting flat 65 observations would suggest it is reasonably minor and
subject to significant rainfall. It is the opinion of the author rainwater ingress is able to enter the lower
wall structure below the uPVC sill and frame and will migrate over time into the lower flat, without
causing issues in flat 67. Loss water could either leak from the frame after entering the wall structure via
the upper window or possibly migrate back under the lower sill from the exterior.
7.0 Survey equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given

0213_SA1.pdf,"The roof has been designed as a “WARM ROOF” as defined by building regulations. In order for this
particular type of warm roof to comply with regulations it should be isolated from the living
compartment by a sealed void between the ceiling and the underside of the insulated roof. The roof
insulation should have a U value equivalent to the designed minimum U value for that element. i.e.
there should be no cold bridges.
The roof over this apartment has not been constructed in accordance with building regulations and is
therefore not compliant. There are cold bridges from uninsulated sections within the void and severe air
leakage into what should be a sealed void above the ceiling. It is the opinion of the author that during
strong winds the roof insulation will have little or no effect at conserving heat within the building, as any
heat transference through the ceiling plasterboard is being carried away out of the building by the
cooling effect of the moving air layer over the plasterboard top side.
Whilst it is conceivable that moisture vapour rising through the plasterboard ceiling could condense
within the roof void on surfaces that are at or below dew point, it is doubtful this will occur as the
moving air would be warmed by heat from the plasterboard and will be constantly changing with fresh
air from outside. It is therefore unlikely that any surfaces will reach dew point within the roof void
except in exceptionally cold and still air. Even then the volumes of condensate water would be fairly
small and unlikely to do the amount of damage that is mainly evident in the bathroom area but to a
lesser degree in the bedroom.
It is the opinion of the author water ingress into the bathroom and bedroom ceilings is from outside the
building envelope and that this is likely to be getting sucked into the building through poorly sealed
areas of the roof by the action of wind blowing against and onto the building from one side which in
turn creates areas of negative pressure on the roof and other side of the building. The author would
stress this is only a logical theory at the moment, based upon the observations and conversation below.
The site Maintenance Manager was present at the time of the survey and stated he had observed during
strong winds the roof sheets bend downwards in places such that there are puddles holding on the roof.
This gives further weight to the theory that this roof is being affected by areas of positive and negative
air pressure. This might cause gaps to open up between interlocking panels and sheets allowing water
to get into the structure.",1
0032_LU1.pdf,"A moisture survey of the property was undertaken (See section point 4.3 & 4.4) which revealed no
raised readings other than to a small localised area of floor where the carpet was pulled back within
bedroom 1 and, likely to be related to ground moisture. The other area (Location point J) likely relates to
where natural airflow is not occurring due to contents being placed against the external wall leading to
possible cold spots.
It was advised that some years ago a section of skirting board was replaced within the lounge along with
an element of plastering to one of the external walls reportedly due to high moisture levels and mould
development. The tenant further advised that dampness was coming up through the carpet within
bedroom 1.
At the time of the survey no mould was noted.
In terms of existing ventilation measures, there isn’t an extraction unit in the bathroom however an
extraction unit is present within the kitchen which does not have an overrun when turned off. This unit
requires a clean for optimum performance. The unit itself is situated next to the window which could
lead to any air coming in being drawn out immediately via the extraction unit. Trickle vents were all
open at the time of the survey and an Environment Positive Vent system was noted which the tenant
has taped over stating this makes the flat cold.
A passive ventilation unit is noted in Bedroom 1 (section 6.3) and appears to be permanently open to
the exterior. This will have the effect of cooling the bedroom and the associated wall making the area
difficult to maintain optimum atmospheric temperatures and could lead to outbreaks of mould when
warm air is introduced via occupancy.
With no mould noted during the survey, it is the opinion of the author that any mould development
within the flat is likely to be related to occupational activity and a lack of adequate ventilation. Effective
extraction in the kitchen and bathroom is a suggestion along with contents items and a sofa being
moved away from external walls and radiators where possible to allow for natural airflow and the
avoidance of a build up of cooler areas on colder external walls.
In bedroom 1 consideration should be given to the open passive vent and the cold marley type floor
finish that will both serve to make this location particularly susceptible to secondary issues when
occupied.",3
0286_TN9.pdf,"The rain simulation test carried out over the water damaged area of the roof did not introduce any
water into the bedroom (see Section 5.4).
No vapour control is present between the insulation and plasterboard (see Section 5.4).
The bathroom extractor does work but clears the air very slowly (see Section 5.5).
The condensation risk analysis shows surface and interstitial condensation is an issue within the roof
(see Section 5.6).
It is the opinion of the author water is appearing on the ceiling in this area as it is dripping from a poorly
placed piece of insulation.",0
0010_CR0.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident confirmed repeated issues in the property with a concern aligned to locating the
root causes being a primary comment adding, mould has affected his clothing items.
Within a short period it was noted the internal atmosphere was significantly warm with a high
temperature noted and, in line with this, only the windows in the bathroom and kitchen were open at the
time of the survey with all installed trickle vents closed.
A visual assessment of the property clearly indicated mould and flaking paint in a number of areas through
all rooms and, this alone could likely rule out the adjoining flat roof still penetrating sufficiently to affect
the property as a whole due to the number of mould locations.
A moisture related assessment of the structure confirmed areas of elevated readings and in general, these
were wet at the base of the walls with drier conditions at approx. 1m above the floor level. In addition,
low level drilled readings into the building fabric to a depth of approx. 1 inch also indicated elevated levels
in the walls and could likely align to a damp related issue across the base of the property.
At the time, an inspection of the exterior did not readily reveal the presence of a DPC and, the number of
air bricks seemed limited for the length of each elevation with none noted along the front as pictured.
From an internal atmospheric perspective, the current internal humidity and temperature levels would
be sufficient to sustain the development of mould through a number of areas and is supported by the
inference of mould on contents items which can only be sustained by atmospheric conditions and not
structural damp.
Regarding ventilation measures there is a non-functioning extraction device in the bathroom with an
identical working unit noted in the kitchen. The kitchen device was isolated at the time and on test using
a hand-held non-conventional anemometer (i.e. not a defined hygrohood due to the closeness of the
adjoining wall) a flow rate of 33 m/s was noted at an acceptable level.
However, both pull-cord units will rely on the resident activating them after using the ‘wet’ rooms they
are located in and, in the absence of this, there remains a strong possibility of warm moist air circulating
the property leading to reported issues in other areas.
In addition, both units are located close to windows and, when using the extractors it is recommended
they are closed along with any trickle vents in these rooms for the extractor to use the internal
atmosphere drawn from the dwelling to expel the generated moist air complying with achieving the
‘whole dwelling ventilation rate’. Open windows alongside working extractors serve to draw in and expel
air from the exterior only.
The floor condition was reviewed and although slightly elevated moisture readings were detected on the
surface, these could align to the floor construction as this was not readily identifiable with what appeared
to be thermoplastic tiles in a number of areas and a decorative floor finish in others plus, the absence of
a number of air bricks to the exterior.
Although air bricks could suggest a floor void, this needs to be confirmed alongside the wall construction
due to the number of elevated moisture readings noted to the lower walls internally. Of note, there was
no clear evidence of retrospective cavity wall insulation however, its possible inclusion at the time of
construction would require confirming alongside any other cavity debris aiding a possible bridging process
and, the removal of a number of bricks would aid determining the above and the condition of the cavity.
With cracking noted in areas of the ceiling, a pin-reading in the bathroom area suggested an elevated
moisture level which could relate to the previous flat roof issue and whether any forced drying of the
structure was undertaken prior to its redecoration. In the absence of such, the high reading could align to
residual moisture in the structure that would also likely link to the blistering noted.
Once the structure has been assessed and noted for any remediations, the internal atmospheric
management requires a detailed overview to ensure compliance with Part F of the Building Regs
concerning wet room extractor flow rates required and their optimum use for the resident. To support
this, all internal doors are recommended to have a minimum 10mm gap between the door underside and
the floor finish to aid ‘make-up’ air entering the wet room and optimising the extractor performance with
these doors all noted to be borderline with this recommendation.
All mould affected areas should be either replaced structurally or, remediated using a recommended
biocide or fungicide (in accordance with manufacturers guidelines) and not bleach which does not kill the
root system (mycelium) with any redecoration being considered once the structure is certified as being
dry to a pre-incident level to avoid repeat spoiling.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there are a number of elements that can all link to the current
internal conditions such that a constructive way forward would be recommended to deal with each
aspect.
The lower wall levels circling the building should be checked for any issues within the cavity plus how the
air bricks function in line with noted floor construction. In addition, a brief thermal check in the lounge
(section 5.1) showed the lowest surface temperature to be very close the existing dew point temperature
for condensation and would align to a lack of ventilation adequacy linked to the forced extraction units,
unopened trickle vents and closed windows in the main living/bedroom area.
Lastly, a detailed check of the ceilings close to the adjoining flat roof should have their moisture content
confirmed to determine their acceptable levels for redecoration works.",1
0123_CO6.pdf,"Remote monitoring has been installed to allow a clear understanding of the variation of atmospheric
conditions in the loft area compared to the living area of the property and the exterior. The monitoring
is still ongoing.
The atmospheric conditions recorded at the time of the first visit to the property showed the
atmospheric moisture load in the loft to be to be between that in the property and the exterior
condition with the level in fact closer to the exterior condition. These observations would tend to
suggest the loft area is being ventilated by the provision installed. However the readings recorded are
only a moment in time plus, due to a warmer air temperature condensation was not a factor.
Having reviewed the loft area the author has to question the effectiveness of the previous clean carried
out. The mould currently is extensive with regard to the underside of the membrane and was reported
to have reappeared soon after the works were carried out.",1
0188_NW8.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant structural moisture levels affecting both the
upper and lower sections of the surveyed exterior walls. In the majority of areas surveyed moisture
levels in relation to the skirting’s were noted which would support timber decaying fungi such as Serpula
Lacrymans (Dry Rot).
With regard to the tops of the exterior walls, issues were highlighted with regard to the condition of the
external render and the detailing of the render & asphalt to the parapet walls and the asphalt upstand
to the chimney (Section 6.1). These issues will allow rain water to migrate into the upper wall structures.
A minor issue was noted in regard to the open pot to the now disused chimney (Section 6.2). With
regard to the moisture issues to the base of the external walls, issues were highlighted with regard to a
debris build-up between the walls and associated garden walls (Section 6.3) and is likely to have
compromised the DPC’s (Damp Proof Course) to the wall structures. Supplied pictorial information
suggested the subsidence remediation works previously undertaken at the property affected what
appeared to be a slate DPC to the original wall structures (Section 6.5). It is not certain what provision
was made during these works to replace/maintain the continuity of the original DPC to the affected wall
structures and if the DPC is compromised, this will provide a route for ground water to affect the wall
structures.",0
0041_LU4.pdf,"Due to most of the tenants asleep in the bedrooms at the time of the survey, a limited number of non-
invasive moisture readings were recorded the majority of which confirmed a dry structure. Elevated
readings were however noted to floor surfaces within the kitchen and are likely to be part of the DPM to
ground moisture.
Regarding how the property is currently being ventilated, there is a working mechanical extraction unit
in the bathroom only with passive trickle vents to the windows.
Observations confirmed condensation on the window to bedroom 3 and mould outbreak on the
bathroom ceiling. Regarding the concerns raised relating to mould development on external wall
surfaces, we are informed that within the last few weeks all the surfaces have been cleaned some of
which have been decorated.
As part of the moisture profiling, an assessment of the internal atmospheric conditions in accordance
with BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: Annex B Moisture
Generation and Ventilation in Occupied Buildings indicated a “moist” occupancy at the time (section
4.5.1).
In conclusion, based upon the observations made and recorded moisture readings it is the authors
opinion that any outbreak of condensation and mould is likely to be associated with inadequate
ventilation during periods of raised internal humidity levels. This is supported by comments concerning
mould on contents items that can only be sustained by periods of raised internal atmospheric
conditions, closed windows and trickle vents

0045_ME1.pdf,"It should be noted access to the kitchen area was limited by the pet dog and, general observations
pointed to there being no significant issues in this room other than the function of the extractor fan.
A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating in general a dry structure with
particular attention in regard to the areas of concern highlighted by the tenant and detailed on the floor
plan. Elevated readings were noted in the bathroom and aligns to the toilet cistern and reported
condensation (Section 6.4). Elevated readings were also recorded to the base of the hallway at survey
location S – T and is recommended this area is further reviewed taking into account the adjoining
kitchen area.
It is the opinion of the author, the source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate is
atmospheric and in general, this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of
the installed ventilation.
Issues were highlighted with the installed ventilation which need to be addressed (Section 6.1) in
particular the fact the kitchen fan unit is not working and the bathroom fan appearing not to be
functioning correctly requiring it to be controlled via the isolator in the hallway which is located at the
ceiling level, and hence is designed to be used to isolate the unit for maintenance purposes.
As detailed in the report the ventilation regulations have been updated.
The thermal survey highlighted issues with the quality of installation of the cavity wall insulation with a
patchy nature of the install shown to be a factor in the pattern of condensation affecting the exterior
walls.",3
0189_OX16.pdf,"It was noted the bedroom has a large amount of furniture within it and is all placed up against the
exterior wall. This will disrupt the natural air flow and allow warm moisture laden air to settle on the
cold surface subsequently enabling condensation to form and at the time of the survey the walls felt
damp to the touch. We understand the mould contamination was treated with anti-microbial solution
and then painted over with Anti-mould paint. Remote monitoring deployed in the bedroom indicated a
lack of air circulation.
Moisture readings were taken through the remainder of the property and at the same point of test as
per the previous report and all were recorded accordingly (see section 4.0).
Following an examination of the exterior of the property it was noted the ground is of a solid clay base
and subsequently all standing water struggles to soak away. The rear garden area slopes towards the
property and during heavy rainfall standing water forms against the brick work to the property. French
drains appear to have been installed, however this is failing to remove the excess water and due to the
level of green discolouration to the brick work at low level it shows this brickwork is mainly saturated.
It was also evident this saturation of brick work was directly opposite the wet internal walls, in light of
this the Technician drilled the exterior brickwork and placed large moisture probes through the exterior
brick until it made contact with the outer face of the internal blockwork and this showed high moisture
levels. ERH probes were taken within the cavity and these came back saturated. An external brick was
removed to expose the cavity and a small amount of debris was found within the cavity which is
blocking the weep holes and causing a bridging effect.
The cavity was exposed and an endoscope inserted to view the cavity tray and cavity space this shown
that debris was within the cavity and in places blocking the weep holes which would allow bridging.
We believe it is a combination of condensation forming due to lack of air flow within the property and a
cavity bridging which is allowing moisture to travel from the exterior skin to the interior.",1
0239_SW1W.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.1) carried out through the
internal areas indicated the loss affected area extends up
at least to the ceiling level to the lower ground floor area
if not higher in the loss affected corner of the room.
Non-invasive moisture readings taken from the external
stonework highlighted significantly raised moisture levels
in the stonework to the front elevation to the left of the
bay. Dry readings were indicated to the bay and across the
rest of the front elevation to the property. The external
readings were taken midway up the pictured window to
the upper ground floor. Observations suggested the raised
structural levels extend considerably further up the
exterior wall.
The observations indicated loss water was actively
draining from the wall structure at the time of the survey
at the level of the DPC in the wall structure to the lower
basement area (Section 6.1.2).
It is the opinion of the author the loss water is entering the affected walls some way up the structure. It
could well be the case this is as high as the level of the drainage hopper and shoot for the rain water to
the flat roof. Loss water would take an extended period of time to drain down through the structure and
could well be hidden through the upper floor areas by wall decoration and possibly previous damp
remedial works.",0
0220_SL9.pdf,"Following further site meetings and inspections it appears the recurring damp issues reported by the
occupant may be caused by water ingress through faulty, and in sporadic places nonexistent, external
render. It was clear to view water, following inclement weather, had become trapped behind the render
and paint finish causing the finish to bubble. Trapped moisture could migrate to the internal face of the
wall. These issues were not apparent during the initial damp survey and the condition of the render has
deteriorated recently.
The occupant has also advised that he does not use the central heating and has not switched it on for
the past 12 months. It was also noted a significant quantity of furniture was sited flush to walls thus
restricting air flow. Both of these issues are likely to allow for condensation problems to manifest within
the property. It is thought that the internal low level damp issues may be as a result of the low
temperature and poor air flow.
During the inspection it was pointed out the chimney breast within the rear elevation bedroom was
suffering damp issues. It would be prudent to carry out a full examination of the chimney stack
Elevated moisture readings were noted to the rear elevation wall with the lounge at low level to a height
of 500mm. The area of damage is to the window wall an area previously re plastered by other
contractors due to damp problems. The render on the corresponding external elevation was found to
have bubbled with trapped water behind it which could migrate into the property.
With regard to the musty smell within the kitchen base unit after close inspection we can concur that
there is a slight odour within this unit. During the initial works being carried out this unit was
completely removed and the contaminated plaster board removed. Following a period of forced drying
the plaster board was replaced with duplex boards with a vapor gap between the structure and board.
We recommend removing the unit to inspect the wall again as this is within the area were the exterior
render is the most severely affected.
Forced ventilation units were fitted to the bathroom and kitchen and these now operate in accordance
with regulation
A moisture survey was carried out to determine the level of moisture to the affected arears and these
recorded (see section 5.0).",1
0054_ME4.pdf,"A number of non-invasive moisture readings were recorded throughout the property which, other than to floor surfaces in all but the lounge,
confirmed a dry structure.
Elevated levels to the floor could be attributed to a combination of the advised burst pipe affecting the foundations and ground moisture.
With mould evident on uPVC windows, regarding how the property is ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in both the kitchen
and bathroom, wall passive vents in the bathroom and lounge which vent to the exterior and, trickle vents to windows most of which were closed
at the time of the survey.
In accordance with BS5250:2002, a “wet” occupancy was calculated as highlighted below which aligns to existing ventilation conditions.
External observations revealed evidence of a DPC but is clearly bridged, and parts of the front and side elevations have had what appears to be
damp proofing measures.
Internal observations revealed evidence of mould at the base of external wall surfaces and on uPVC window frames. Furthermore, it was noted
there is trapped moisture coming up through the resilient floor covering in the bathroom.
In conclusion based upon the information gathered including the thermal survey and recorded moisture readings, in the author’s opinion issues
relating to mould will be driven by inadequate ventilation and raised humidity levels. In regard to the recorded elevated readings across floor
surfaces, the likely cause could possibly be driven by the advised discharge from the burst pipe and ground moisture.
Mould on uPVC and kitchen units for example are driven by atmospheric moisture levels and not structural damp. However, areas of the property
that were affected by the original incident should have undergone structural drying where appropriate to remove the wetness and reduce the
amount that would wick into the atmosphere and then combine with internal living conditions such that the increased situation expedites the
potential for mould.

0155_IV25.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through all three properties and various methods were
deployed to allow a clear understanding of the various slabs moisture condition.
A dry condition was clearly indicated with regard to properties 8 and 12. In property No. 10 a significant
water leak was identified in the bathroom area (Section 5.7.3) and was pointed out to the homeowner.
The leak significantly increased the electronic readings in the affected area. However the in-depth
samples taken for analysis in this area still showed low moisture levels, in fact a dry condition. This was
discussed with the testing laboratory who felt the concrete slab would be reasonably waterproofed
considering its age and makeup.
The thermal survey carried out through the various properties showed condensation and raised
resultant relative humidity to be the drivers for the mould activity noted at the reported locations.
In all three properties issues with the forced ventilation of the kitchen and bathrooms was noted and is
documented.",1
0120_CO14.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted raised moisture levels in the exterior wall originally
reported as being an issue. However significant raised moisture levels were identified in the floor screed
and wall structures focused on the en-suite bathroom to bedroom 1 and in particular the mixer tap to
the shower in this area.
The floor structure to the property is suggested to be block and beam which, due to its age should be
insulated. If this is the case the screed should be reasonably isolated from the exterior walls by the
thermal barrier to its perimeter, the insulation layer and the membrane possibly also in the
construction.
The levels of moisture affecting the defined floor area and internal walls would suggest an internal issue.
As mentioned the loss area is focused on the shower to the en-suite and in particular the location of the
mixer control. There may well be an issue with the plumbing in this area or even an issue with the seal
of the unit to the waterproof structure of the shower cubical.",0
0061_PO20.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised her concern regarding the internal temperature and at the time, the
heating was on and an average temperature noted through the property was 17.8oC which could be
attributed to the heating level selected.
Bedroom 2 to the front of the property was advised as being the main area of concern with mould recently
removed from areas behind the bed and dressing table both of which related to the RH side wall as viewed
from the front. The resident added this wall had undergone remedial works including tanking and, an
assessment with an electronic moisture meter emitted elevated readings across the entire elevation likely
suggesting the plasterboard is foil-backed which would affect the device being utilized.
A thermal assessment of the area (Section 5.0) indicated the lowest recorded temperatures at the surfaces
being viewed was circa 7.5oC at low level with a calculated dew point temperature in this room being
11.2oC suggesting condensation is a likely occurrence.
However, damp penetrating aspects cannot be ruled out because an external assessment of the same wall
did not reveal a DPC but, did indicate a painted skirt to the exterior that extended up approx. 400mm
from the side path that in areas was abutting the wall with air bricks situated close to the base level.
Elements of the upper render finish appear to have been repaired however there remained areas of
cracking and gaps that will allow rainwater to penetrate but not be able to escape and, may therefore be
able to travel to the inner skin leading to wetting of the internal elevation.
In addition, there appeared to be possible evidence of drilled holes that could align with Cavity Wall
Insulation (CWI) being utilized however, this was not confirmed nor noted when observing through one
of the air bricks.
The cavity wall construction and advised timber suspended floor internally did not align with the absence
of air bricks at low level serving to provide air circulation of the void area.
If indeed timber elements are observed in the habitable rooms, their structural integrity will require a
detailed assessment due to inadequate ventilation that serves to drive ground moisture out reducing the
potential for affecting the timber.
Of note is the render finish and solid skirt to the exterior was observed to all external elevations apart
from the front with no other issues noted or mentioned that could align to similar reason.
Concluding the exterior observation the resident added the concrete doorstep leading to the front door
appears to flood after rainfall. A visual assessment found no reason for this occurrence and, the concrete
slab was sloping away from the property as would be expected however, when this reoccurs, it is
recommended the resident provide images of the areas as a whole to aid reasoning for this aspect.
Internally the resident mentioned periods of condensation to the loft hatch and the thermal assessment
confirmed it is not insulated above with a recommendation to consider this.
A review of the loft as a whole indicated insulation measures across the ceiling area that could be
considered uniform in areas supported by minimal temperature differences noted in each habitable room.
An assessment of the existing ventilation measures was undertaken and, the bathroom intermittent
functioning device delivered an acceptable flow rate of 15.2 l/s with a 15 minute overrun after the light is
switched off. However, to support device performance the bathroom door should be closed when in use
with a 10mm undercut enabling ‘make-up’ air to enter the room and draw out the generated moist air.
The door and threshold gap appeared to be less than the recommended 10mm and therefore requires
attention.
Advice was imparted to the resident to keep the window and trickle vent closed when the extractor is
operating in order the device uses internal air to clear the room and not simply draw in and vent air from
the exterior.
The kitchen extractor is located above the cooker but not in a cooker-hood. A flow rate of 17.4 l/s was
recorded and is below that recommended for a kitchen device in Part F of the Building regs.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a potential structural dampness issue remaining with
regard to the front and rh side elevations of bedroom 2 that will ideally require an invasive assessment of
the floor void condition to determine if any CWI is in the cavity that could be compromised by the
condition of the external render, if a DPC is being bridged by the external finishes and if the floor void is
compromised that, if timber elements are confirmed, could result in a deterioration of the their condition
in the absence of defined air bricks below the floor level.
It was noted external air brick plates were indeed installed but appeared to be above the floor finish level
internally and will serve to cool the outer elevations leading to colder internal conditions with a raised
potential for condensation when the rooms are in use.",1
0055_ME5.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised of concerns mainly to an area of the lower wall and skirting in the
hallway just before entering the kitchen. In addition, the boxed-in original fireplace was also advised as
having previously been an area of a leak that has since been repaired.
It was also mentioned a cupboard to the first floor and areas of the bedrooms have also displayed mould
and concerns remain with regard to their likely causes.
A moisture profile through the ground floor of the property including the main areas of concern suggested
residual elevated readings to the base of the walls and some skirtings. However, apart from some mould
to the hallway area, there was no evidence of spoiling including blistering, cracking etc to the walls and
hence could align to the construction with possible ground moisture still evident from the solid floor due
to possible gaps in the floor membrane which was indeed evident in areas that could lead to the low level
dampness.
Readings to the floor in areas aligned to a solid floor construction with the moisture meter likely able to
detect moisture through the tiles acting as a membrane. The only area of damage was to a localized
section of the laminate floor beneath where a chair is located. If this were to be fully investigated the floor
finish would have to be uplifted but again, could relate to a gap in the installed membrane.
A review of the exterior confirmed an irregular drill hole pattern that could align to an injected insulation
process. That being the case, where the internal dampness and mould was noted to the hallway by the
kitchen, two holes were drilled in the external mortar bed in order to assess %WME with deep probes
and, ‘at risk’ levels of moisture were detected but could well align to the inner leaf being read because
the level of drill holes was above the internal floor level and the insulation was sporadic.
A borescope was inserted and significant gaps in the injected CWI was confirmed and, with this in mind,
it is recommended this external location undergoes a removal of 2 to 3 bricks in order to accurately assess
the cavity condition plus the CWI and its effectivity because more drill points may not serve to determine
the condition of the CWI due to its potential gaps in coverage.
Of note, any wet insulation is a key observation in this process as it could readily align to the elevated
moisture readings and mould on the inside such that, if any wet insulation is located, it is suggested the
property considers undergoing a detailed removal of the material.
Observations to the first floor areas of concern could align to a lack of air circulation which was notable in
the landing cupboard whereby a sloping external roof line may not be insulated serving to cool this area
and, when opened will allow warmer air to enter and become trapped in the cool environment leading to
periods of condensation. An option is to consider installing passive louvres top and bottom of the
cupboard door to aid air circulation and seek equilibrium with the surrounding areas.
In the rear bedroom, mould patches were observed to the upper wall/ceiling junctions above the window
and will likely also align to a lack of air circulation which is common in the corners such that, with colder
temperatures noted in the thermal survey (section 5.4), condensation is the most likely reason.
In the front master bedroom a thermal review did not highlight any areas of concern that could align to
possible significant gaps in the CWI. A thermal image (section 5.5) confirmed expected colder areas that
in the absence of adequate air circulation, can lead to periods of condensation.
In addition, it was also noted the fitted wardrobes extend to the front external wall and, with closed sliding
doors, can also serve to trap warmer atmospheric moisture within it when opened. Suffice to add, to the
exterior two passive vent plates were observed in this area that will encourage this potential problem
because it will serve to make the inner leaf wall colder that will likely be within the wardrobe. The use of
the air bricks should be assessed for their expected installation outcome otherwise, could be considered
for removal (Section 6.6).
Lastly, an assessment of the installed ventilation measures was conducted with no forced ventilation
noted in the kitchen resulting in greater reliance on purging generated moist air through the windows and
moreover, via open doors to other areas of the property which can have a detrimental impact in the
internal atmospheric conditions.
The bathroom extractor isolator switch was noted to be out of reach and required secondary elements in
order to switch it on. On test the unit was just below that recommended for a bathroom (section 6.7) and,
with inadequate door undercut, will struggle to achieve clearing the room as a whole especially with the
door closed which could lead to having the window open at the same time.
Whilst this may seem to be a positive aspect, the extractor located on the external window wall will serve
to draw in and expel air from the exterior only and, places a greater emphasis on the door undercut being
adequate to aid clearing the room as a whole.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author the CWI may not be adequately covering the cavity
construction and, whilst this may not be a singular issue, where the mould has been observed, it is
recommended an invasive check is undertaken to ensure the CWI has not been affected by wetting that
would resonate to the interior.
In the absence of any issue in the cavity, an assessment of the floor tiling that may well be acting as a DPM
is reviewed for its coverage and effectivity.
Additional potential contributory factors include a lack of forced ventilation in the kitchen and inadequate
door undercuts to aid air circulation through the property.",1
0124_CR0.pdf,"It is believed there are a number of issues relating to high moisture in the utility room. The chemical DPC
is injected into the engineering brick rather than the natural route of moisture between the mortar
joints and therefore the effectiveness of the chemical DPC is questionable. There is also less than 25mm
clearance from the external finished floor level and the DPC that may allow water to enter the wall
above the DPC. Movement in the foundations and walls could also have compromised the DPC and any
DPM if present.
The single skin uninsulated wall to the utility room had condensation occurring during the survey and
the calculated dew point in the room was 9.0°C with the lowest wall temperature recorded at 7.5°C,
suggesting condensation was likely to be occurring. With the washing machine, fridge freezer,
microwave and boiler all operating within this area of 2.5m², the level of moisture in the room and walls
will likely remain constantly wet.
A confirmed leak from the wall hung boiler in the utility room and indications of a possible further leak
behind the washing machine were observed at the time of survey and the home owner commented the
boiler was being repaired and that every morning she ‘vaxed’ water from the utility room floor.
The utility room, also described as an outhouse, displays evidence of a waste pipe junction blocked up
under the boiler (see section 5.3). The new roof appears to be in good repair, however the single skin
walls are likely to be wet and their location suggests the building suffers from prevailing weather
conditions and the close proximity of fencing that will reduce the warming effect from the sun.
It is therefore the opinion of the author that the future ongoing use of the single skin utility room is a
consideration as it appears to show a number of issues combined with appliances being used that are
leading to outbreaks of condensation. Although some of these issues can be rectified, due to the nature
of its construction issues such as condensation and ground water may persist.",1
0299_WD24.pdf,"During the survey it was noted there is mould contamination to high levels within the 2 bedrooms,
entrance hallway, bathroom and en-suite. It was also noted that on entering the property the
atmospheric conditions felt extremely humid and very warm.
The property owner has a 10 month old baby and insists on keeping the windows and doors closed and
the property well heated. It was also noted the clothes are washed and dried with a washer dryer and
then placed on a clothes horse within the lounge. At the time of the survey it was noted the bath had
been used at 8 am and that the bathroom area was still saturated with condensation. A single-ply
section of tissue was held up to the forced ventilation unit in this area and actually blew outwards
indicating that the unit could either be blocked or non-existent and therefore not operational. A line out
of the property could be determined during the survey.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out and mapped accordingly together with atmospheric
conditions within each room. Following the moisture checks it was found that all areas are within
acceptable tolerances with the exception of the bathroom following recent use.
It was noted the only form of ventilation to the property is the forced air units within the bathroom, en-
suite and an extractor hood above the cooker. The windows are fitted with trickle vents but we're closed
at the time of inspection. There are only 2 adults and 1 baby living within the property with 1 adult out
at work during the day. It is the opinion of the author the property is suffering from a condensation
problem due to a lack of adequate ventilation.",3
0168_ME2.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry condition with regard to the wall structures
however, raised moisture levels were indicated in the bathroom and bedroom areas. With regard to the
bathroom, the elevated levels were associated with the boxing to the rear of the toilet and further
invasive investigation may well be prudent. Raised levels were also indicated to the side and rear of the
bath at survey locations K and L, which would be indicative of previous or ongoing issues with the bath
seal. Raised moisture levels were indicated in relation to the exterior wall to the bedroom survey
location ‘M’ and is the opinion of the author condensation issues are a contributory factor in this area
(Section 7.2).
Ventilation is an issue at the property with no forced ventilation provided in either the bathroom or
kitchen areas (Section 6.2). The property is occupied by six people with an additional seventh person
every other weekend and is the opinion of the author this is a mitigating factor in the issues being
experienced (Section 7.1). The tenants stated they have issues with opening the windows and would
certainly not leave windows open when the property is unoccupied (Section 7.3).
It is the opinion of the author the issues affecting the property with regard to mould growth are driven
by atmospheric moisture levels which in turn is driven by occupational activity. Issues with ventilation
and levels of occupation are mitigating issues.",3
0119_CM6.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out through the property with particular focus on the areas of concern
(Section 4.0) and in general indicated a dry structure. However, elevated readings were noted to the base of the
exterior wall to bedroom 2 at survey locations 7, 8, 9 and 10.
At the time of the survey laundry was drying in bedroom 1 on an electrically heated airer and in the entrance
hallway on an airer.
It is the opinion of the author, the source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate is atmospheric. In
general, this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of the installed ventilation with air
and surface temperatures also having an influence.
Regarding the current ventilation provision (Section 6.1), the survey shows, the property does not meet the
requirements detailed in the Building regulations – Approved document F – Effective from 2010 regarding both the
flow rates of the installed fan units and the “Whole Dwelling Ventilation Rate” which should be provided by
controllable passive ventilation such as the trickle vents to the window units. It should be noted Approved
document F – Effective from 2010, has been updated to Approved Document F - 2021

0183_NE43.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) showed the reported loss affected areas to be dry and the thermal
survey (Section 5.0) showed condensation was not an issue at the time of the survey. In general minimal
staining was noted in the highlighted areas of the structure apart from the plasterboard surfaces above
the doorway from the surveyed lounge to the rear bedroom area, survey location ‘D’ (Section 7.2). It
was reported a lack of cavity tray provision in the upper wall structure above survey location ‘D’
combined with water ingress is the cause for the issues at this location (Section 7.3). It is the opinion of
the author however the exact nature of the wall structure needs to be confirmed and will allow the
which could provide cooler surfaces for interstitial condensation to be an issue.
A review of the ventilation in the adjoining bathroom and en-suite areas highlighted significant issues
with the ventilation systems installed (Section 6.0). Remote monitoring was installed in the property
monitoring the atmosphere in the loss affected rear lounge and the main lounge area to the front of the
property (Section 4.3). The monitoring showed the moisture loads through the property to be
reasonably consistent with only a very minor drop in air temperature noted in the rear lounge. However
it is the opinion of the author colder external temperatures would have produced a greater variance in
air temperature. The average dew point temperature through the monitoring period was 8.2°C.
In relation to the glazed roof structure namely survey locations A – B, a significant variation in the
glazing joint was noted (Section 7.4) and could well lead to water ingress with the right external
conditions but in the opinion of the author, would allow cold drafts to affect this part of the structure.
Due to the nature of the loss and observations made it is the opinion of the author condensation both
surface and interstitial would be likely causes for the issues being experienced.",1

Scope
Following instruction from ………………………, attend the above property to report on current moisture
conditions and investigate the causes for reported mould affecting the structure.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a top floor flat in a purpose-built block
possibly dating from the late 1960’s of concrete frame
construction with cavity brick and block walls noted to the
exterior and observations indicating retrofit cavity wall
insulation has been installed. Plasterboard ceilings were
noted throughout above which is the loft area to the
pitched roof.
2.0 Incident:
Persistent and extensive mould growth is affecting the
structure and contents. The tenants have lived at the
property for a number of years and was reported mould
started to be an issue during the first winter and has been a persistent issue since, with a noticeable
increase during the winter months.
3.0 Conclusion – 3rd March 2021:
A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) confirming in general a dry condition through the
property and in particular, the areas where mould growth was noted. Some elevated readings were
recorded but, observations would strongly suggest the noted levels were driven by condensation
occurring prior to the survey which would have wetted the structure in these areas.
With regard to the ventilation of the property it was noted the kitchen does not benefit from an extractor
fan and significant issues were noted with the installation and function of the bathroom fan unit. Upon
arrival at the property it was noted windows were open in the kitchen and bathroom however, in the
bedroom the window could not be opened.
Based on the observations made it is the opinion of the author the mould affecting the property is being
driven by persistent elevated humidity levels which in turn, are driven by occupational activity and issues
with effective ventilation of the property.
It was pointed out by Mr. Harvey his wife has significant health issues which make her susceptible to cold
and, they are finding it difficult to maintain an acceptable temperature in the property making effective
passive ventilation an issue.
3.1 Recommendations:
Landlord:
It is recommended the following works are carried to allow the tenant to better control the structural and
atmospheric moisture levels in the property and hence further mould growth:
 Provide effective forced ventilation to the kitchen and bathroom areas whereby the installation
of continuous running fan unit with a humidity-controlled boost function is recommended. These
should be sized to comply with regulative requirements to provide an acceptable level of
background ventilation through the property at all times.
Continuous running units with a humidity-controlled boost will, in conjunction with the natural
permeability of the structure, provide continuous background ventilation to the dwelling. When
fan units are specified and installed follow up flow rate checks should always be carried out to
ensure the units are compliant and meeting the designed specification.
Tenants:
The consideration and control of atmospheric moisture is a priority and can be achieved by ensuring the
following points are carried out which will optimize the internal atmospheric conditions:
 Use of extractor fans once installed during periods of high moisture production, for example
when cooking and bathing.
 Ensuring areas of moisture production such as the bathroom, are kept closed from the general
environment until the extraction system has reduced the excessive atmospheric moisture levels.
 Try not to dry laundry in the property. If there are no options available, always provide adequate
ventilation by opening windows preferably providing a cross flow of air through the property.
During the winter months when external temperatures are low or when security is an issue,
drying small volumes of clothing in the bathroom with the door closed and bathroom extractor
working would be the best option.
 Use of trickle vents and window ventilation as needed.
 If tumble dryer units are to be used in the property, they should always be used and maintained
as specified by the manufacturer and vented to the exterior.
 Use the heating in the property to maintain an adequate and even internal air temperature.
 When cooking put lids on saucepans when possible to reduce evaporation.
 And if possible, move furniture in the property to prevent the buildup of areas of still cold air
against exterior walls.
3.2 Conclusion 17th January 2023:
tenants are currently not living at the property and, it had been cleaned such that there were no obvious
signs of mould activity. The ventilation system had been upgraded from the initial visit in 2021 however,
there are issues in regard to the new units which need to be addressed as detailed in section 6.1.7:
 External louver to the bathroom fan needs to be replaced.
 The route of air discharge to the kitchen fan unit needs to be confirmed.
 The combined continuous flow needs to be increased to achieve the ‘Whole dwelling ventilation
rate’ calculated at 15.0 Litres/Sec based on the floor area plus number of bedrooms as detailed
in the building regulations – Approved document F 2000 – Effective from 2010. Plus, it should be
noted this standard has been updated to Approved document F 2010 – Effective from 15th June
2022.

5.0 Thermal survey:
5.1 Bathroom - survey location A:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within the survey area was 14.6°C this being base of the
window. In regard to the base of the exterior wall the
surface temperature was 15.8°C. The calculated dew point
temperature for the atmospheric conditions was 12.4°C.
Condensation was not an issue in this area at the time of
the survey but, is highly likely it was an issue earlier in the
day wetting the affected structures.
In addition, at the time of the survey the resultant %RH
(Relative humidity) adjacent to the colder wall surface was
86.6 %RH, sufficient to sustain a wide variety of moulds.
5.2 Bedroom - survey location F:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within the survey area was 17.1°C this being base of the
exterior walls. The calculated dew point temperature for
the atmospheric conditions was 12.1°C. Condensation was
not an issue in this area at the time of the survey, but was
highly likely it was an issue earlier in the day.
6.0 Observations and relevant information:
6.1 Ventilation:
6.1.1 Passive ventilation:
It was noted uPVC windows with trickle vents are installed
through the property and a number of them were open as
were windows to the kitchen and bathroom. In the kitchen
a noticeable drop in atmospheric moisture levels was
noted.
It was noted the bathroom passive vent could not be
opened.
6.1.2 Forced ventilation – Bathroom:
The unit installed in the bathroom runs continuously with
a boost function which is humidity controlled and operated
via a pull cord.
Standard:
No air flow was noted during continuous running.
Boost:
Air speed: 2.6 m/sec.
6.1.2.1 Function of the bathroom fan:
It was noted the recently installed bathroom fan has been
installed using the duct and old flapped vent to the
exterior. It is the opinion of the author this is greatly
affecting the fan function such that when not on the boost
function, the air flow produced by the unit is greatly
reduced.
In addition, the proximity of the fan to the open window is
clearly evident.
6.1.3 Effective operation:
To allow effective year-round ventilation of the bathroom it is recommended make-up air is drawn from
the rest of the property via an undercut to the door. It was confirmed in general the bathroom window is
open allowing make-up air to be draw in through the window rather than the rest of the property via the
undercut. Drawing make-up air in through the window will greatly reduce the fan unit’s ability to remove
the moisture laden air from the bathroom plus, preventing the fan unit from assisting the general
ventilation of the property when constantly running.
6.1.4 Make-up air flow into bathroom:
Regarding the undercut to the bathroom door, Part F of the Building Regulations requires a gap of 10mm
between the base of the doors through the property and the decorative floor finishes. Observations would
suggest the gap under the bathroom door is not sufficient.
6.1.5 Kitchen ventilation:
The kitchen area does not benefit from forced ventilation such that, installing an extractor unit in this area
will greatly assist the tenants in controlling the humidity levels in the property.
6.1.6 Fan flow rates requirements:
The following flow rates are required in accordance with Building Regulations:
Continuous running fan with boost function:
Kitchen: 13 Litres/second (Boost function)
Bathroom: 8 Litres/second (Boost function)
This is based in the fact an effective compliant continuous air flow is being achieved through the
property by the fan units installed.
6.1.7 Replacement ventilation - 17th January 2023:
Following the initial visit the ventilation system had been upgraded and below is the recorded flow rates
from the installed fan units.
Bathroom extractor:
A continuous running fan with boost function is installed in
the bathroom.
Standard:
Air speed: 0.66 m/sec.
Boost max. speed:
Air speed: 2.36 m/sec.
When initially tested at standard flow rate, it was noted the
air flow was into the property and checks to the exterior
showed the louver had not been changed when the fan was
changed. This louver was not compatible blocking the air
flow with the flaps having to be lifted for the recorded levels
taken.
Kitchen fan unit:
A continuous running fan with boost function is installed
and checks failed to identify how the unit is venting to the
exterior such that it needs to be clarified.
Standard:
Air speed: 0.58 m/sec.
Boost max. speed:
Air speed: 2.67 m/sec.
Fan flow rates requirements:
In regard to the forced ventilation in the property, continuous running fan units with boost function are
installed.
Building regulations indicate the following flow rates are required as detailed in:
Approved document F 2000 – Effective from 2010.
It should be noted this standard has been up-dated to Approved document F 2010 – Effective from 15th
June 2022.
Approved document F – 2000:
Continuous running fans with boost function:
Required boost function flow rates.
Bathroom 8 Litres/second
Kitchen 13 Litres/second
In addition to ventilating the kitchen and bathroom there is also a requirement to achieve the ‘Whole
dwelling ventilation rate’. In the case of continuous running fans with boost function this is covered by
the continuous running rate of the installed fan units combined. Which in regard to the surveyed property
is 15.0 Litres/Sec base on the floor area plus number of bedrooms.
In the case of Ø100mm fan units and air flow rates above 8 Litres/Sec. at this diameter they can start to
generate noticeable noise levels leading to units being switched off when being run continually. If the
ventilation system is to be upgraded, it would be prudent to install a Ø150mm unit is the kitchen.
6.2 Mould activity:
Extensive mould growth is affecting all areas of the
property with both the structure and contents affected. In
the case of mould affecting contents this can only be
sustained by the atmospheric moisture conditions in the
property. This being elevated atmospheric moisture levels
(g/Kg) and cooler air and surface temperatures driving
elevated relative humidity levels (%RH).
The main driver which allows moulds to develop and
flourish in and on the materials within a structure is
moisture or, to be precise, water activity. Materials can
become damp in a number of ways, directly being wetted, moisture penetrating materials through
capillary action, physical contact and hygroscopic materials absorbing moisture directly from the
atmosphere.
There are many hundreds of mould varieties each requiring different levels of water activity to allow them
to develop and flourish. The lowest known level of water activity at which mould can be active is 0.61. In
general, this level collates to an atmospheric relative humidity (RH) of 61%. Condensation does not have
to form on a surface. For there to be sufficient moisture to allow mould to become established at the
point where condensation occurs, the relative humidity will be 100%.
Moulds are simple fungi from several groupings in the fungal classification system. Sexual reproduction in
some fungi allows genetic modification to adapt and tolerate changes in the environment such as
humidity, temperature and food requirements.
There are three principal features common to the broad range of mould:
1. Simple food requirements: able to exist on non-nutrient materials such as plaster and brick which
have traces of contaminating organic matter.
2. Produce vast number of spores which allow rapid adaptation to particular environments
conditions and rapid colonization of other suitable locations within an enclosed environment.
3. Grow very quickly under suitable conditions. The main requirement for the development and
growth is a source of moisture although food, oxygen and a suitable temperature are also
important.
Moulds can be regarded as hydrophilic fungi (tolerating high water availability) although individual species
have their own optimum requirements for moisture. In most situations where surface condensation
occurs and or the relative humidity of the internal atmosphere exceeds 70% (0.7 aw) for an extended
period, mould growth will be established.
Mould is opportunist and once established in a property will quickly colonize areas with appropriate
conditions. Most properties through their normal occupational cycle will have periods of high
occupational moisture however, it is the prolonged periods which will allow mould to develop. Once
mould is present in a structure the period of time it will take to colonize new areas is reduced due to
the increased level of spores being produced in an enclosed area. In many cases a process of mould
removal is required to allow a satisfactory outcome to change in occupational activity when trying to
prevent further mould activity.

survey and determine the underlying causes for reported issues of damp and mould.
Report
1.0 Property description:
The property is a one-bedroom mid terrace bungalow
built in the early 1950’s. The property benefits from
gas central heating, rendered cavity brick/ block walls
with retrofitted Cavity Wall Insulation, loft insulation
and uPVC doors, windows, facia and soffits. The
original heating source would have been Solid Fuel
Rayburn or similar but this has been removed and the
chimney sealed and ventilated. All walls have a DPC
situated at floor level and the solid concrete floors
have a surface fitted DPM of thermo-plastic floor tiles.
2.0 Incident:
The tenant has lived in the property for four years and during this time it has been noticed the underside
of the mattress on her bed has been suffering from mould. Clothes and shoes have also been mouldy
particularly those in the cupboard situated in the corner of the sitting room. The tenant has been using
two domestic dehumidifiers (one in the bedroom and another in the wardrobe) to try to keep the
property dry and are both run during the night. Windows are opened during the day when the tenant is
at home and the weather permits. Trickle vents are noted to all windows and are kept open but the
windows are closed at night for security purposes as this is a ground floor property.
Mrs Oakley has a tumble drier and a washing machine but these are located in the former coal house
which is accessed via the rear of the building. There is a passageway on the bedroom side of the
property to access the garden for two adjoining properties.
The property is located alongside a drainage brook and the field behind floods in the winter. Mrs Oakley
has lived in the village all her life and advised that in the summer of 2012 the Brook burst its banks
flooding the land to the rear and the gardens up to floor level. Since 2012 local farmers have cleaned the
drainage ditches and raised the banks of the Brook which has prevented any more serious flooding
during the 2013 floods on the Somerset levels. The property was built in the early 1950s and in 1953 it
was flooded above floor level.
Mrs Oakley has her meals brought in by her daughter and heats them in the microwave. She has
disposed of her cooker as she was worried that cooking was creating moisture which in turn was causing
this problem. She had her washing machine and tumble drier moved to the outside store room.
Mr & Mrs Williams, the neighbours in No 16 advise they have been suffering from similar problems in
their bedroom which is on the other half of the passageway accessing the gardens. It is possible the two
incidents are related and is therefore recommended a survey of this property to inspect for common
issues is considered.
3.0 Disrepair Items
No concerns of disrepair could be identified and maintenance of the building appeared to be up to date.
Gutters were not blocked or choked. The loft insulation was well laid and to a good standard of thermal
insulation, however, there was one area of insulation that had been missed and this is referred to later
in the conclusion and recommendations. There are no extraction fans or ventilation systems fitted in
this property.
4.0 Conclusion from first visit of 22nd October 2015:
On the day of the survey it was requested any dehumidifiers were kept switched off and that all
windows were closed in order to acquire an indication of atmospheric conditions without any artificial
drying of the air or influences from external conditions. Atmospheric readings taken at the point of
arriving at the property and after hour later are recorded below at Section 6.3.
Taking into account the two incidences of flooding and that it is known water tables have risen in recent
years, it is the opinion of the author the water table beneath this property is probably not far below
ground level and is having an influence on moisture levels in the floors and the occasional area within
the lower part of the walls.
The property was inspected in all areas the Author could obtain access to either walls or floors. A section
of possible damp where mould has occurred was found on the front left hand side of the bedroom. No
damp was measurable in this area and likewise throughout the property whereby all the walls appeared
to be ‘dry’. The REL readings in the walls were in many cases just above 200 and whilst these might be
shown as being ‘at risk’, it is the author’s opinion they are not significant in indicating any damp within
the walls. All of the %WME readings within the walls were in the ‘dry’ range with exceptions being in the
timber skirting’s where the highest recorded was 22% MC in the left hand corner of the front of the
bedroom. The raised %MC in the skirting board is probably caused by some minor bridging between the
damp floor and the wall above since the DPC is located just about at floor level however, the amount of
moisture in this area is relatively insignificant.
There were two areas of damp found in the floor of the bedroom. The first being to the left hand side
front and the second immediately beneath Mrs Oakley’s bed. The latter area of damp is quite significant
as it covered at least 50% of the area beneath the double bed and was clearly not related to anything
Mrs Oakley had done i.e. no spillages and whilst she has a small dog she was certain that it would not be
pet damage.
The floor of the property is concrete and covered with thermoplastic floor tiles which have been used as
the DPM. It is believed that in places this has broken down and since the water table beneath the
property might be fairly high as indicated above, it could be there are one or two localised areas where
the density of the concrete is such that it is holding or allowing through moisture from below the
ground. It is recommended the bedroom area be inspected thoroughly to see if there are any defects in
the floor beneath the carpet. This will inevitably involve moving the furniture and taking up the carpet
and should be arranged with the tenant.
Mrs Oakley was asked about her water bills to see if the amount of water used had increased recently,
as this might indicate a leak beneath the property. The tenant stated that the water bills had increased
earlier in the year but were now back to their normal levels.
An inspection of the cavity walls to the side passageway showed the cavities have been insulated with
blown glass fibre insulation and was probably carried out between 15 and 20 years ago. Thermal
imaging of the bedroom walls showed there is some slumping of the insulation to the top of the
passageway walls and around the property creating a cold spot at the top of the wall which is likely to
have condensation and mould spots associated with this cold bridge and, this would be more prevalent
if the atmospheric moisture levels are raised as a result of damp ingress through the floors.
A Boroscope inspection of the passageway cavity walls show that the blown glass fibre insulation had
some small voids within it. Whilst the thermal imaging was not carried out in ideal conditions due to the
mild weather, it did tend to indicate the insulation has some areas which are not as thermally efficient
as others i.e. possible voids.
Atmospheric readings were taken of the air inside the cavity wall along with the corresponding external
reading. Those tests (section 6.3) did not show any indication the cavity wall insulation is damp.
A remote monitoring unit was installed under the bed and the tenant was asked not to use the
dehumidifiers during that time. The results were monitored over a 10-day period and apart from an
isolated period the RH and SH did not increase much beyond the results obtained at the time of the
survey. The slight increase could have been due to using the shower.
A call to Mr Lee Brooker-Kent at Homes in Sedgemoor was made with a recommendation that an
investigation beneath the carpet in the bedroom is made since the floor covering in this area was giving
a WME reading in excess of 90%. Due to the tenants pet dog being very unwell, this investigation was
put off until after the New Year and an appointment was arranged for 11th January 2016.
Findings and Conclusion from visit on 11th January 2016
A site visit was made by 2 Technicians to lift and move the bedroom furniture and Mrs Oakley advised
she was happy for an exploratory area to be cut in the carpet as it was due to be replaced shortly. The
wooden framed double bed was found to have a broken centre rail which was supported on an old VCR
and a stack of books (section 7.2). The bed was uplifted and moved to one side and the carpet was cut
immediately in front of this support as that appeared to be the area with the highest WME in the carpet
and was in excess of 90%. Gaps between the thermoplastic floor tiles were found in this area as these
are normally laid very tight to each other.
The following readings were taken.
 On the surface of the tiles the WME was 18%
 Between the gaps in the tiles the WME was 35%
 The REL on the tiles measuring moisture below the surface was 913.
 A thermal image at the point of opening gave a surface temperature of 14.5°C and was
checked with another thermometer which gave a temperature of 14.3°C
 The RH in the room was 63.5 at 18.5°C giving a dew point of 11.4°C and Specific Humidity of
8.6 g/kg of air.
 Externally the atmospherics were RH 72.6%, ambient temp 8.6°C, Dew point 3.8°C and 5.0
g/kg specific humidity.
Given the mass of the floor and the surface temperature at the time of opening up, the moisture in the
carpet being caused by condensation on the surface of the tiles can be eliminated. As the surface
temperature was well above dew point and Mrs Oakley runs a dehumidifier at night this would reduce
the RH and subsequent dew point temperature, keeping it well below the surface temperature of the
sub floor. The property is well heated with a comfortable temperature well above dew point being
recorded. The remote monitoring unit had shown the carpet temperature in the damp area under the
bed was almost constant around 17.5°C and being a thin carpet I would expect the sub floor surface to
only be a few degrees below this.
Leaks from the wet gas central heating system can be eliminated as the pipes serving the radiators drop
down from the loft and the boiler is located in the outside utility room.
In the area, to the front of where the bed support was, the Author drilled down into the floor
screed/concrete approximately 50mm and took %WME readings as it appeared the carpet was wet.
These gave a WME of 38% and 29% immediately after drilling and 50% and 44% after 15 minutes to
allow for time to reach an equilibrium.
The underside of the carpet at the point where the VCR had stood was reading WME 90% + and a stain
had appeared exactly where the VCR was. This was indicative of water being drawn into the carpet at
that point and holding it i.e. not evaporating quickly.
Externally the field to the rear of the property was partially flooded (see section 7.6). The water level in
the field was approximately 300 mm to 450 mm below the floor level inside the building.
From the evidence gathered, the high water table is the only explanation for the moisture getting into
the floor and is the author’s opinion the problems of mould in this building are being caused by an
increase in the atmospheric moisture load resulting from moisture being drawn up by capillary action
through the concrete floor between the tiles and into the carpets and room.
Whilst Mrs Oakley is trying to reduce this by using dehumidifiers, this has the opposite effect by
lowering the vapour pressure internally which in turns draws moisture into the carpets and rooms i.e.
defeating the drying process as she is trying to dry out the ground.
The DPM floor tiles laid on the concrete floor are not able to cope with the ingress of moisture into the
concrete floor caused by the high water table. A better quality DPM is a suggestion as this will hold the
moisture back as it would be impossible to lower the water table since the property is built on a flood
plain.
There is a small amount of bridging to the DPC in places as indicated by the high %MC readings in the
skirting’s. This might not be problematic and could possibly be left alone however, an assessment needs
to be made if the floor tiles are removed, as it might be that the screed needs to be removed to get
below the DPC.
5.0 Recommendations:
5.1 Extraction fans could be installed in the kitchen and bathroom. Ideally these should be set at
an RH of between 65% and 70%.
5.2 The ceiling above the cupboard in the lounge would benefit from insulation. (see section 7.3).
5.3 The existing thermoplastic floor tiles could be removed to assess the screed condition and
levels in respect of the existing DPC.
5.4 The property would benefit from an inspection of the sewers for any damage.
6.0 Moisture Survey and Floor Plan
6.1 Occupation:
1 adult and a small dog reside at the address.
6.2 Ventilation:
There are no mechanical or electrical fans installed in this building and it is a recommendation fans are
considered for installation in both the kitchen and the bathroom.
6.3 Atmospheric conditions at Level III Survey
Atmospheric readings were taken at the start of the survey and 1 hour later for comparison. Windows
and external doors were kept closed as much as possible but some traffic with visitors was noted.

7.0 Observations:
7.1 DPC to the building:
The DPC to the building is about 50mm below the inside
floor level and could create a bridge to transmit moisture
from the floor into the wall.
7.2 Temporary Bed Support
The area beneath the temporary bed support shown was
very damp with a WME in the carpet of 90%+. This shows
the broken central slat being supported by a VCR and
books
7.3 Cupboard in Lounge:
The cupboard in the lounge has a ceiling that is
completely uninsulated. It is a recommendation this
should be insulated as it forms part of the loft.
7.4 Sub Floor
The cracks in the sub floor are wider than normal i.e. tiles
are usually laid tight but are 2–3 mm wide where
inspected. %WME readings at 50 mm depth in the
screed/concrete showed that the concrete is moist.
7.5 Wall adjoining Hallway
The wall front LHS window adjoining the hall had staining
from moisture. This was dry at the time of survey but the
skirting had a MC of 22% and could be an area of bridging
to the DPC by the floor screed.
7.6 Exterior of property showing flooding:
The water level in the field behind the property is
between 300 mm and 450 mm below finished floor level
inside the building.
8.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
A Protimeter Aquant BLD5760 moisture detector, using radio frequency survey method, giving readings
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. This gives readings for moisture in materials up to a depth of 19 mm
depending on material characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for
interpretation, therefore they should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
A Protimeter Mini BLD2000 using electrical impedance survey method on wood and other non-
conductive materials. On wood it measures moisture content from 6% to 28%, the level at which the
fibres are saturated. In other non-conductive materials the instrument measures the WME (Wood
Moisture Equivalent) up to 28%.
The WME value is a theoretical moisture level that would be attained by wood that is in moisture
equilibrium with the material being tested. The full measurement range is from 6 to 90 but values over
Readings at depths from surface readings up to 25 mm (Using a hammer probe) can be taken.
Cavity and confined space Moisture readings using a Rotronic, high precision temperature and humidity
probe, together with a fully specified HygroPalm23-A calibrator handheld with full logging functions
Destructive testing:
Actual moisture content: Where a very accurate moisture content is required this is done using an
Ashworth Mears “Speedy” moisture tester that gives actual moisture content by a % of weight of a
sample that is removed from the structure and tested.

0263_TA7.pdf,"My survey of the building has revealed that the damp areas are confined mainly to the lower
sections of the gable wall and front wall on the ground floor. In particular the worst area is to the
right hand side of the front door internally and the adjoining gable wall where wet cavity wall
insulation has previously been removed. I have considerable experience of failed cavity wall
installations and it is my opinion that there has been a partial failure of the cavity wall insulation
on this property particularly the area mentioned above as a result of the extreme exposure of this
building and the poor condition of the rendering. This is likely to spread to other areas of the
wall unless stopped, removed and dried out swiftly.
Where cavity wall insulation fails and no adequate means of ventilating the area is installed, but
continues to be surrounded by cavity wall insulation that is wet and blocking airflow, it is highly
unlikely that the wall will not dry out. In this instance it is evident that rain water is getting into
the cavity wall as a result of the poor condition of the rendering, as this is detached from the
background brickwork and is hanging in large sheets.
My survey revealed that there is an area of wall approximately 2 m² where insulation has been
removed to the right-hand side of the front door as viewed from inside and partially along the
gable wall. Viewing this with a Boroscope it is quite apparent that this large area is bordered on
all 4 sides by insulation. In this instance there will be no airflow in this area and as a
consequence interstitial condensation will almost definitely occur. This will also create a cold
spot where moisture from within the fabric of the building will condense. It will also be wet
from water leaking in through the defective rendering and external skin of the cavity which
bridges the cavity on dirty wall ties and via the wet insulation. Below is a picture at 7.13 showing
water seeping out of the brickwork to the left-hand side of the front door externally just below
the render level.
The lower section of the gable wall stair string is clearly rotten and has moisture content well
above that acceptable for organic materials (See 6.4 below). I am of the opinion that rot or fungal
growth might well be present here and further inspection is needed at the time of replacement. If
dry rot is present this must be treated with a solution of Boron and the whole area isolated using
boron paste in any wood that remains or masonry remaining up to 1000 mm from the infected
area. It is also important to check if there is any dry rot present and ensure that mycelium a dry
rot roots are not spreading within the cavity wall insulation. If this is the case the whole cavity
wall will need to be thoroughly sterilised inside the cavity. There is also the risk of wall tie
failure from ties that have rusted out. This should be inspected after removal of the cavity wall
insulation.
Atmospheric tests in the cavity void to the front and cavity wall insulation revealed a very high
relative humidity and specific humidity in the cavity. The specific humidity is more than double
that externally and is sufficiently enough above the internal specific humidity to be able to be
create a high vapour pressure, where moisture transmission will be from the cavity to the inside
building envelope. A Speedy moisture test of the cavity wall insulation adjacent to the front
gable wall had approximately 35% by weight moisture content and this was likely to increase at
times when the temperature in the cavity drops below dew point. On the day of survey DP was
approximately 17.5°C in the cavity and night-time temperatures where as low as 2°C, it will
almost definitely cause moisture to condense within the cavity wall and internal temperatures
probably drop to that level of less during the night.
An inspection of the loft avoid has revealed that it is quite likely that there is a leak around the
chimney breast. However I was unable to inspect this due to access across the insulated area.
There is no verge, soffit or ridge roof ventilation to the property. Token retrofit vents have been
placed in the roofing felt overlaps; however these are largely ineffective except in extremely
windy conditions.
The sloping roof sections are uninsulated. However I am advised that ventilation pathways have
been created in these. If that is the case the effect without insulation would merely cause that part
of the ceiling to be excessively cold and therefore highly susceptible to condensation and the risk
of mould build-up. This is likely to be the case in bedroom 1 where the mould is quite severe
(see picture below).
There is no verge or soffit ventilation anywhere to this roof void. My recommendation when this
building is re-roofed is that all sloping areas of ceiling are properly insulated and over fascia
ventilation is installed around all 3 elevations together with vapour permeable roofing felt.
Ideally a dry Ridge ventilation system should also be fitted.
Overall the level of insulation in the roof void on the ceilings is approximately 300 mm however
infrared pictures did reveal that there are minor areas around the edge of the rooms and sloping
soffit, where the insulation is not in contact with the ceiling, particularly around the edges.
One aspect of the ventilation to this property is that there is no form of mechanical ventilation to
either the bathroom or the kitchen and I would have felt that this property would benefit
substantially from good ventilation in both cases.
There is no downpipe to the front corner elevation. The fact that a small amount of weed growth
was visible in the gutter on the gable wall would lead me to believe that in heavy rain these
gutters are likely to overflow although the tenants were unable to confirm if this happens,
however it might be that in heavy rain they don't actually go out to witness this. The overhang to
the tiles and the steepness of the roof pitch would also suggest that during heavy rain water
might overshoot the gutter. This might well have contributed to the early failure of the rendering.
This should be addressed if re-roofed.
There is a DPC visible on the outside wall and this would suggest that the builders would have
also installed one on the inside. If that is the case it suggests that the cause of the damp is likely
to be from wet cavity wall insulation or where the CWI has been removed, interstitial
condensation is occurring.
There is no visible evidence that there has been a failure of the DPC to the inside leaf of wall, but
when the rotten stairs are repaired it would be an ideal time to carry out further investigations to
check this. Notwithstanding the evidence appears to suggest that the main problem with damp is
caused by moisture migrating through from the wet cavity wall insulation. This is bringing the
dew point within the wall closer to the inside surface creating a cold spot where condensation
from the atmosphere within the property is largely due to poor ventilation. Airborne moisture
will migrate to the coldest spot. Electromechanical ventilation to the bathroom and the kitchen
will largely solve this problem and re-insulation of the building, if relevant, will maintain a
uniform surface temperature over the inside walls.
There is no specific evidence of any structural movement in the walls, however this, along with
the cavity and wall ties, should be inspected further when the defective rendering is removed so
as to determine the structural condition of the building.",1
0089_TA6.pdf,"The tenant has reportedly resided within the property since July 2017 and reported issues of damp and
mould mainly within the bedroom on the external wall at base level. An issue of condensation has also
occurred to all the uPVC windows throughout.
A moisture profile of the affected areas gave elevated readings at base level to the external walls and
from the marley floor tiles within the bedroom and external observations did not reveal any obvious
defects which would allow for any potential moisture migration into the structure.
No mould was noted at the time of the survey however, the tenant advised surfaces had recently been
cleaned and repainted.
A number of moisture traps were also noted within the bedroom and lounge with the only provisions for
ventilation being trickle vents which, other than in the lounge, were all open at the time of the survey.
During our attendance contractors arrived to install an extraction unit within the bathroom, which in the
opinion of the author will greatly improve the issues in the property.
Contents within the bedroom had been moved away from the external wall in preparation for the
surveyors visit.
Unit 52 Broadmarsh Business Centre, Harts Farm Way, Havant, Hants, PO9 1HS
At survey location points A and B drilled readings were recorded at base level to the external walls at
two different depths with moisture levels reducing further into the structure.
The carpet was taken back within the same location points with a damp patch in the corner to the
underlay with the underlying floor also being visibly wet when the underlay was pulled back.
Condensation was shown to be an issue in this area at the time of the survey.
Based upon the above observations both internally and externally as well as both invasive and surface
moisture readings, the surveyor is of the opinion that any reported mould or condensation is mainly due
to insufficient ventilation throughout the property.
Whilst it was observed that an extraction unit was being installed within the bathroom, if issues persist
then an additional unit is recommended within the kitchen. Furthermore, moving furniture from the
external wall will encourage natural airflow along these inherently cooler surfaces.",3
0033_LU1.pdf,"We understand a leak occurred some time ago from the boiler located in the lounge and following
forced drying, the affected carpet in the hallway was replaced with lino flooring. The tenant advises a
concern relating to the lounge carpet where a stain is present which he believe is due to the leak.
A moisture survey was undertaken to the whole property which in general was dry with elevated
readings relating solely to the kitchen and hallway floor where bitumen is present beneath both floor
coverings thought to be acting as the DPM. Readings were also taken to the carpeted floor within the
lounge where the staining was present with it being noted as dry. We were further advised the stain was
not noted until the previous sofa was moved with the affected area only evident beneath the position.
The tenant added his concern with the property being very difficult/expensive to heat and an inspection
of the loft revealed insulation noted to be bundled sporadically with a supporting certificate stating
insulation had been installed in 2013. The tenant also advised that in relation to the heating within the
property the heating system is set to the highest point whenever the property feels cold and turn the
heating off when leaving.
In relation to ventilating the property there is no extractor unit fitted in the kitchen however, a 100mm
diameter extraction unit was present within the wet room and on test registered a flow rate of 0.4m/s.
This however only lasted for approx. 10 seconds before failing to draw air although the unit continued to
simulate operating. Trickle vents were open and clean at the time of the survey.
In conclusion it is the surveyor’s opinion the structure is dry with no elevated readings recorded other
than where ground moisture is to be expected. With regards to inadequate heat, a static vent located in
the bedroom wall will serve to cool the wall and air in this room which will not aid the temperature
through the property and the thermal images indicated sporadic gaps in the loft insulation. Significant
fluctuations with heating the property can also result in cooler structural temperatures leading to the
impression of feeling cold whilst in the property.
With regard to the staining of the carpet, no elevated readings were recorded at the time of the survey
and, with it also being advised that a sofa was previously sited in this area the surveyor is of the opinion
the damage present may well likely relate to foot traffic and/or furniture being dragged across this
location (see section 5.1). A clean to the carpet may reveal any such markings and improve the overall
impression.",1
0221_SL9.pdf,"compromising the DPC to the wall construction. In addition water testing showed rain water ingress
under the garage door is affecting the area of concern.",0
0013_CT5.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0)
this highlighted in general a dry structure certainly this
was the case in the area highlighted by the tenant as
being areas suffering from persistent mould activity. There was one area displaying elevated structural
moisture this being the rear wall to the lounge, it is understood previous damp remediation works have
been carried out in this area (Section 6.4). Further invasive review of this area may well be prudent for
example to confirm the integrity of the DPC.
With regard to the majority of areas being affected by persistent mould activity it is the opinion of the
author atmospheric conditions are the main driver. This being elevated internal atmospheric conditions
combined with cooler surfaces temperatures leadings to resultant persistent elevated relative humidity
levels and associated mould growth.
The survey did highlight issues with the forced ventilation in the property (Section 6.1), with issues
noted in regard to both the bathroom and the kitchen area ventilation. As mentioned, the Kitchen is
opened plan to the rest of the ground floor and the stairs and lending to the first, this will allow
atmospheric moisture generated to freely migrate through the property.
As regard to cooler wall temperature the thermal survey did identify sporadic surface temperature to
the gable end wall. We understand wet cavity insulation has previously been removed (Section 6.3).",1
0040_LU4.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey revealed a dry structure throughout other than to an area of the ceiling close
to the extractor in the bathroom plus, an area of the floor in the same room which likely relates to
occupational activity or possible residual moisture from previous plumbing issues.
At the time of our survey there were no signs of any mould development and could be due to the fact
the tenants may have recently cleaned the surfaces.
With regards to passive ventilation there are no trickle vents to the uPVC Windows with most of them
closed at the time of our survey. Passive vents were noted in bedrooms 2 and 3 and within the lounge
with the vent in bedroom 3 being closed and the unit in the lounge blocked by storage containers.
There are two 100mm extraction units set within the ceilings of both bathroom and kitchen and both
appear to operate via a pull cord. However, the unit in the bathroom at the time of the survey was not
working. Looking at the exterior it could not be identified precisely where the extraction units vent out
to which should be investigated further. Further noted is that the unit in the kitchen does not overrun
when turned off.
A visual inspection of the loft space revealed insulation in various thicknesses however it was evident
that the majority had not been rolled out which will likely result in cold random areas throughout.
The windows to all of the bedrooms were condensing at the time of our survey and the tenant advises
that over time plaster has been removed and reinstated to all walls within bedroom 1 and anti-mould
paint applied.
A condenser dryer is noted which appears to be in good order.
With no mould present at the time of the survey and a generally dry structure, it is the opinion of the
author that any report of damp and mould probably relates to occupational activity and a lack of
adequate ventilation. Bedroom 1 is noted to be North/West facing and as such will not benefit from the
suns rays. This room therefore relies upon a balance of heat and ventilation to ensure the internal
atmospheric conditions are optimized. Any furniture located against the prevailing cooler external walls
will encourage the onset of conditions pertinent to the outbreak of mould.",3
0092_TN22.pdf,"At the time of the survey there were no recorded elevated moisture levels on any surfaces throughout the flat confirming a dry structure.
As to how the flat is ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen which appear to have been well
maintained as have the trickle vents all of which were open. The mechanical extraction units however are not currently compliant with building regs
part F likely impairing the management of generated internal humidity conditions. Furthermore, observations did not clearly show these units
venting to the exterior.
There was only some minor evidence of mould observed relating to a small surface area on the bedroom ceiling, the party wall at mid wall height in
the lounge (survey location point 4) and on the bed base (see observation section below). The tenant brought it to the authors attention that in
November the entire flat was redecorated with an application of anti mould paint. The tenant also wanted it to be made clear that on a daily basis
due to her condition of OCD, surfaces throughout are cleaned including the trickle vents.
The thermal imaging survey set out below, either showed condensation was occurring or, conditions at wall surfaces were as such that mould is
able to develop and thrive.
In conclusion, it is the author’s opinion the concerns raised by the tenant regarding mould is driven by periods of raised internal humidity levels and
inadequate ventilation supported by the fact a dry structure was recorded and the vapour pressure difference recorded at the time of the survey. The
tenant confirmed the mechanical extraction units are very seldom utilised and when they are in use, they are not meeting building regs.

0277_TN2.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out at the property and in general a dry structure was
indicated. However high structural moisture levels were indicated in relation to the exterior walls
associated with kitchen sink and may well indicate a plumbing leak in this area. Further investigation
would be prudent.
Mould activity was indicated to the hallway to the ground floor (Section 5.1) however a reasonably dry
structure was indicated. It is the opinion of the author the driver for the noted mould was atmospheric
conditions combined with cool surface temperatures.
With regard to the floor structures, observations showed the decorative floor coverings through the
property are acting as the DPM to the concrete slab construction apart from the dining area which has
what appears to be floor screed which is installed on a plastic sheet DPM.",0
0295_W2.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted raised capacitance readings (REL(PS)) through the majority
of the survey locations and would suggest raised moisture levels affecting the wall structures. However,
it was reported damp remediation works have already been carried out throughout the property. In the
majority of the surveyed locations, dry skirting’s were noted with corresponding dry skim plaster
(%WME) combined with undamaged wall decoration. The REL(PS) readings electrical characteristics at
depth into the wall are likely to be behind the previous remediation render finishes.
It is the opinion of the author through the majority of the property the previous damp remedial works
are functioning correctly preventing significant moisture levels and hygroscopic salts migrating to the
wall surface. However, a number of areas did display damp skirting’s and skim plaster combined with
decorative failure. Salts analysis in these areas suggested a ground related moisture issue. It is the
opinion of the author damp remediation works need to be carried out however these only need to be
limited to the indicated areas and will be localized in nature. It is always recommended remedial works
are carried out by an approved contractor and covered by an insurance backed guarantee.
There was a significant amount of contents in the property at the time of the visit which to a certain
extent limited the survey however all the areas displaying decorative failure were surveyed.",1

Scope
Following instruction from ………………. attend the above property to undertake investigation in to cause
of damp to ground floor bedroom.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a three bedroom end of terrace house
over three floors. Tiled pitched roof, part wood clad part
block external walls with a DPC noted. Internal walls are
dot/dab with concrete floors with a marley type tile
covering. Property has gas central heating and older style
uPVC windows most do not have trickle vents.
2.0 Incident:
The tenant reports dampness and mould to master bedroom on ground floor. Silverfish and slugs are
also reported. The bedroom is currently not being used and is shut off from the rest of the house.
3.0 Conclusions:
The dampness within the bedroom mainly relates to an external wall where the tenant reportedly had a
number of wardrobes up against but with the reported amount of mould on the back of these units,
these have now been removed.
It is reported 1 adult and 3 children live at property with the adult and 1 child in mostly during the day.
Between 7 and 10 washing loads are processed each week via vented washing machine. There is a
tumble dryer which is not used very often. The tenant advised clothing is dried on radiators in kitchen
only.
Raised moisture levels were noted in main bedroom only on the external wall where sections of wall
coverings have already been removed by the tenants boyfriend (section 6.1).
The dehumidifier currently running is keeping atmospheric conditions within the bedroom under
control.
Thermal pictures taken within the bedroom highlights cold areas especially at point d on our map. It is at
this point where a draft is entering the bedroom and high moisture readings were recorded.
At time of visit, no silverfish or mould was noted or, any condensation.
A visual inspection of the external wall down the side of the property between survey points B & D was
made which revealed the DPC (section 6.7) which until recently, would appear to have been breached by
a large quantity of shingle. This shingle has now been removed and set into plastic containers which
remain on site. Also, there are gaps between joints on the external wall which need attention as at
present there is a clear draft entering the main bedroom.
In conclusion on today's visit, the only issues relate to the main bedroom on the ground floor.
High moisture readings were recorded on the external wall (survey points B & D).
The cause of conditions noted relates to the long term bridging of the DPC by shingle and, areas of gaps
to joints on the external block work which needs attention.
4.0 Recommendations:
 Ensure there is no bridging to the DPC.
 Ensure on the external wall all pointing and any areas of mastic are in good order and sealed.

0266_TA8.pdf,"Constructions of houses in this form were popular in the 1950's and were designed like this to
speed up construction and simplify the construction process. My research has turned up a paper
from the West of England University stating that about 12,000 properties were constructed in the
South West using this design.
The design of the capping units to the roof created a cold bridge to the internal leaf of the
property. Defects in the roof tiling causing leaks can result in water running down to the lower
edges of the sarking felt, and as this area often deteriorated first, water can get onto the wall plate
units. Condensation from within the roof void and cavity can also deliver moisture to the units.
There is evidence that both of these have been happening as seen from from the staining on the
underside of the units, (See picture 7.1 below).
One capping unit on the rear of the building is showing signs of structural failure (see pictures
7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 below). The crack on this unit extends for almost the full length of the concrete
unit which is estimated at 1800 mm.
Not knowing the arrangement of the reinforcing steel within this pre-cast unit has to pass doubt
upon its structural integrity since it is impossible to determine how internal stresses might be
applied and where the next crack might occur. Whilst this is primarily a fully supported unit
sitting on top of the cavity wall, it does have a cantilevered component to it and there do not
appear to be any links within the steel reinforcing. Therefore excessive jacking from the rusting
distribution rebar could cause a fracture to occur laterally along the wall line. This could
potentially give rise to a very large section of concrete weighing between 20 and 40 kilograms to
fall to the ground. This is therefore a very serious health and safety risk.
to prevent water ingress into the concrete. This has fractured right through at the end bearing.
the UPVC window. Whilst the other end is simply supported it will be in cantilever and 7.6
shows that there has already been some twisting movement since it is displaced both vertically
Kg might break away and fall to the ground. Other windows on the property have also had lead
capping put on them that indicate this has been an ongoing problem for a number of years.
Gradual disintegration of the precast concrete units to the wall plate, lintels and cills is
inevitable. The capping of lead to some of the lintels is only a token and very temporary
measure. Carbonation and rusting will continue to take place irrespective of any lead capping.
This is not a matter of ""will a failure occur?"" but ""when it will occur"". Unfortunately it is
impossible to put a timescale on when this will happen.
It is unlikely that there would be a catastrophic structural failure resulting in major damage to the
structure. The greatest and most imminent risk is to the safety of the occupants or any third party
visitors. Therefore the sensible option would be too:
a) Replace the cavity closure units under the wall plate and remodel the top of the wall.
b) Replace the concrete lintels over the windows and doors with a modern insulated steel
lintel.
c) Replace the cill sections with a modern precast ""stooled"" concrete cill available from",0
0177_N1.pdf,"Following our recent visit it was noted this is a ground floor flat with the room in mention being at low
level with the rear being below ground and the front segment being open to a lower small courtyard.
it was reported the low level to one small section of wall was possibly damp as it appeared discoloured.
A small section of skirting and plasterboard to the affected area was removed and noted the section is a
concrete pillar to the corner of the room. It was also observed the plasterboard was standard 12.5mm
boards with no insulation.
It was also observed that although the wall was discoloured, the plasterboard was perfectly intact with
no damage and the MDF skirting boards were also in good condition. Following further investigation it
was noted the room enjoys underfloor heating with no radiators. The exterior wall construction to the
lower level was 9"" stone and was also observed that directly opposite the affected corner was an
exposed mortar joint at low level however, there were no signs of moisture ingress within the room to
indicate this being the cause.
The exterior of this room is an excavated courtyard and to this section it is obvious that no sunlight
comes in contact with the wall as green algae is prominent and further down the wall where the sun
indeed strikes, there is none.
It was also noted the underlay to the carpet is foil backed which would reduce the heat from the under
floor heating and the carpet, which is a wool mix Berber with a polypropylene backing, has mould to the
face of the carpet and the backing is delaminated.
The only form of ventilation to the room is the trickle vents which at the time of the survey were closed.
In addition it was noted there was a clothes horse within the room full of laundered garments.
It is the opinion of the author that condensation is forming caused by damp clothes within the room
condensing on the cold surface of the wall where the concrete pillar is sited. In turn this is then changing
back to a liquid form and dripping down the wall onto the carpet which would explain the area of
damage to the section of carpet around the wall area.
After recording the room temperature it was noted the surface of the wall within this area was 0.8oC
below the ambient room temperature.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out together with atmospheric conditions within each room of
the basement level and recorded accordingly.
During the survey it was noted that throughout all the other lower level rooms there was no damage
however within the bathroom and en-suite the two forced air ventilation units were in-line fan systems
and the actual fan is within the cupboard to the upper level room. After holding a single ply tissue paper
to each fan whilst in operation, they failed to hold the paper freely in place.
However when reviewing the air flow extracted to the outside of the property the flow is strong leading
to question if the length of ducting from the fan to the housing within the rooms is too long, hence
reducing the air flows. There is slight evidence of mould growth to the sealant within the main
bathroom which is adjacent to the room in mention and effective remediation would be recommended.
It is the opinion of the author although internal vapour pressure is calculated to be just within the
recommended occupation as per BS5250:2002 for a dry occupation, inadequate ventilation and the
drying of clothes internally is leading to periodic raised atmospheric conditions and internal structural
damage. In addition we would advise the consideration of insulating the concrete pillar to improve the
dew point level as it would be considerably colder during the winter months.",1
0219_SG5.pdf,"The property owner highlighted various places where the timber floor within the Playroom, Study and
Hallway had started to cup and it was explained the property had suffered an escape of water and
following a deployed drying regime, it was declared dry.
Detailed moisture checks were undertaken to determine the exact level of moisture within the sub floor
and the laid timbers. The readings indicated that at the time of survey the sub floor was found to be dry
along with the timber floors.
Readings were also taken by drilling 18mm bore holes through the timber floors to a depth of 60mm
into the sub floor. ERH probes were inserted to determine the ERH readings and temperatures within
each test point. In addition moisture readings were taken at skirting board level and to the walls within
the affected areas.
Following the survey a small section of the reinforced floor was excavated. It was noted the screed floor
was laid to a depth of 100mm and exposed the DPM which appears to be over a Block and Beam floor as
the external periscope vents would indicate.
Following the moisture survey many areas were found to be within acceptable moisture tolerances
however raised levels were detected in areas of the screed at depth and is the opinion of the author it
would be advisable prior to reinstatement to apply a liquid DPM.",0
0028_KT7.pdf,"There were issues concerning access with the survey being carried out over two days and both having
time restrictions limiting the survey mainly to the areas of concern on the ground floor and selected areas
to the first.
The detailed moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted elevated readings in regard to the lower areas of
the ground floor rear wall running through the lounge and kitchen. As detailed the rear wall to the
property is of cavity construction (Section 6.3) and as such, if a rising damp issue is affecting the structure
then, understanding the integrity of the cavity in regard to bridging of the DPC to the inner leaf plus,
detailing in regard to floor structures etc. is critical in understanding the possible routes of moisture
migration and appropriate remedial works.
Recorded atmospheric moisture levels and thermal imagery (Sections 4.4, 4.5 & 5.0) showed
condensation was also a consideration in understanding the reported issues.
Ventilation issues were highlighted in regard to the installed forced ventilation to the kitchen and
bathroom areas, in particular meeting the ‘Whole property ventilation rate’ requirement as per part F of
the Building regs.",1
0122_CO4.pdf,"Structural moisture levels were recorded through the property where mould activity was indicated and
reported. The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure. The atmospheric moisture levels
recorded in the property at the time of the survey were noted to be elevated (Section 4.3) as were the
levels recorded through the remote monitoring period (Section 6.0). Based on BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of
practice for control of condensation in buildings’, the occupancy would be classified as ‘wet’.
Issues were noted with the forced ventilation in the property to the bathroom (Section 7.1.2) and the
cooker hood to the kitchen area (Section 7.1.3). Ventilation is critical in the property and as the
bathroom is internal it relies totally on the extractor unit to remove damp air from the area when in use.
The kitchen area is open plan to the lounge and as such damp air generated during cooking will easily
migrate through the property.
There did not appear to be any provision for the external drying of laundry and is likely laundry is dried
in the property.
It is the opinion of the author the atmospheric moisture load in the property is a prime factor in the
conditions being experienced and its control is paramount in alleviating the reported issues.",3
0297_W6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry structure a variety of survey methods were
used. It was indicated by the tenant significant water ingress through the exterior walls was a major
concern. The indicated moisture condition of the external walls did not support the reported
observations.
Failure of the decorative wall finishes and minor mould activity was noted in the lounge area with
additional mould activity noted in other areas through the property (Section 7.2 & 7.5). It is the opinion
author the damage to the decorative wall finishes and mould activity is being driven by condensation
and raised relative humidity levels driven by high internal atmospheric levels in association with cold
surfaces.
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) highlighted varying surfaces temperatures in relation to the external
walls. Checks were made which indicated consistent low moisture condition across the varying wall
temperatures.
A possible issue was indicated with the control of the extractor unit to the bathroom area (Section
6.2.1), however in general the extractor units servicing the bathroom and kitchen appear to be
adequate.
Heat retention in the property (Section 7.3) it was reported by the tenant heat retention in the property
is an issues certainly in the lounge area. Raised internal atmospheric conditions combined with cold
surfaces temperatures are most likely cause for the issues being reported.",1
0077_SM2.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0)
and in general indicated a dry structure however, a
number of areas did display significant structural moisture
levels namely:
 Survey location C in the bedroom to skirting at the base of the exterior wall with the likely cause
being condensation affecting the area earlier in the day.
 Hallway survey location E with damp noted to the ceiling and skirting. The ceiling has been lined
in this area and further investigation may well be prudent. However, due to the ventilation
issues the noted damp may well be due to condensation, affecting surfaces when the associated
bathroom is being used.
 Lounge survey areas M and O with elevated readings noted to the base of the exterior wall.
These areas are behind the sofa and curtains and, condensation is the suggested driver for the
noted elevated readings.
Regarding the elevated structural moisture levels, these are not the driver for the elevated atmospheric
condition in the property rather, they are most likely the driver for the noted structural moisture.
Significant levels of atmospheric moisture were recorded in the property and, in regard to BS5250 the
occupancy would be considered to be a ‘wet’ occupancy (Section 4.4.1). Issues were highlighted with
ventilation of the property as detailed in section 6.1 and included the effective background ventilation
of the property plus forced ventilation of areas of moisture production namely the bathroom and
kitchen. A PIV unit was noted installed in the bedroom that vents into the hallway. The unit was not
working at the time (Section 6.1.5) and, the tenant was un-aware of its existence.",1
0006_CM9.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating in general a dry structure
however, elevated readings were highlighted to the edge of the ceiling in bedroom 1 aligned to a cold
strip to the edge of the ceiling (Section 5.1). In bedroom 2 it was noted covings have been installed
which is either hiding and/or alleviating the issue.
Wet conditions were reported to be an issue affecting the loft and, it is not certain if this is driven by
rainwater ingress or a significant condensation such that further inspection is recommended. The tenant
supplied an image of the affected loft area (Section 6.2), which could suggest the ventilation provision in
the area has been compromised.
Elevated relative humidity (%RH) levels were noted in all areas of the property and is the opinion of the
author, the source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate is atmospheric. In general,
this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of the installed ventilation with
surface temperatures also having an influence.
The survey highlighted the fact neither of the fan units in the bathroom or kitchen are currently working
with an electrical fault etc. noted (Sections 6.1.2 & 3). This is a significant issue which needs to be
addressed.",1
0255_TA6.pdf,"One adult resides at the property processing one washing load per week either dried outside or on a
clothes horse within the property. Mould was observed to be present on the external walls at base level
in the lounge at survey locations A thru F (see section 5.1) plus, an element of mould noted under the
toilet in the bathroom at point J.
At the time of the survey most of the trickle vents were open as were some of the uPVC windows.
In the kitchen a 150mm diameter wall mounted ventilation unit operated by a pull cord delivered a flow
rate of 3.0 m/s on test. This equates to 53 l/sec and is just below the recommended 59 l/sec when
located away from a hob with a 15 minute overrun.
In the bathroom a wall mounted 100mm diameter unit also operating via a pull cord separate from the
light switch, delivered a flow rate of 0.6 m/s on test. This equates to 4.71 l/sec and is below the
recommended 15 l/sec with a 15 minute overrun for this location.
A detailed moisture survey (section 5.0) revealed the structure to be dry other than to a section of
external wall at base level directly behind where the sofa is located on the wall between survey
locations A and F on the moisture map.
A visual inspection of the flat roof did not reveal any obvious defects as did a visual inspection of the
exterior brickwork.
An inspection hole was created on the external wall at base at survey location F into the cavity which
revealed a lack of insulation at this particular point. To the same section of wall on the inside, drilled
moisture readings were recorded at various depths which did not indicate an ingress.
It is the opinion of the author the mould outbreaks are likely due to a lack of ventilation in the property
and the drying of clothes particularly during the cold periods that, with contents positioned against cold
exterior walls, will lead to ongoing mould outbreaks.",3
0134_DT4.pdf,"We understand that one adult and one teenager reside at the property with the adult in residence
mostly during the day and are advised there are 2/3 washing loads processed per week dried either
outside or, within the flat with the aid of a clothes horse.
The UPVC windows do have trickle vents some of which were open at the time of our survey as were
some of the windows. On inspection these appeared to be in a clean condition.
In the kitchen a 150mm diameter extraction unit which was not in use at the time of our survey. The
tenant confirms that she has never used this unit and was noted there is no fuse to this unit.
In the bathroom a 100mm diameter extraction unit operates via a pull cord separate to the light switch
and on test, produced a flow rate of 1.4 m/s with no overrun. This equates to 11 l/sec which is below
the recommended 15l/sec.
In the kitchen elevated areas were localised to the washing machine at survey location E. There are
plastic bags placed down the side of the unit and when in use, heat from the unit will become trapped
and lead to localised condensation.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out and raised moisture levels were noted to base levels on the
external walls in the main and were confined to low lying areas. Slight signs of mould and flaking paint
were noted and at survey locations A and L, damage to the floorboards was noted.
At the time of our survey thermal imaging revealed condensation was an issue at survey location E and,
a consideration at locations D & L. This is indicative of cold spots and can be attributed to contents
placement and any localized structural issues.
To the front of the property one of the airbricks appeared blocked restricting air flow into the sub floor.
In addition poor pointing and bridging from a concrete cover fillet were noted that could lead to
localized dampness at the base of the walls. As cavity insulation cannot be ruled out, it is possible its
coverage and effectiveness together with localized wetting from bridging and pointing could be leading
to the recorded dampness in the property.
It is the opinion of the author the mould outbreaks are likely due to a lack of ventilation in the property
and the drying of clothes particularly during the cold periods that, with contents positioned against cold
exterior walls, will lead to ongoing mould outbreaks.
Externally, localized issues including bridging, a lack of floor void ventilation and the effectiveness of any
cavity wall insulation is recommended to be reviewed. Internally, the floorboards to the affected
locations should be lifted to assess the void structure to eliminate any sources of ingress. If the localized
damp areas persist, it may be a consideration to undertake invasive checks of the walls including in-
depth reading and/or gravimetric tests of the structure.",3
0282_TN34.pdf,"The moisture survey undertaken through the surveyed locations (Section 5.0) indicated a dry condition
with regard to the skirting’s and in general the skim plaster finishes (%WME). However, raised levels
were noted in relation to the skim plaster finishes to the base of the exterior lounge wall at survey
locations E & F. With regard to the capacitance/radio frequency search mode readings taken, high levels
were indicated to the lower areas of the wall structures through many of the survey locations.
Observations made would suggest previous damp remediation works have been undertaken (Section
8.4). The moisture profiles indicated the surveyed wall structures would be indicative of previous works
having been undertaken, namely remediation measures isolating wall finishes and skirtings from damp
to the wall structure. With regard to the raised search mode readings recorded in the wall structures
these may well relate to the suggested remedial works undertaken. Dampness noted in the wall
structure will not drive mould activity if prevented from migrating to the surface finishes. With regard to
the exterior walls to the lounge, wallpaper decoration was noted in this area and, wallpaper finishes
which are affected by condensation will tend to stay damp for an extended period of time when
compared to painted wall finishes.
With regard to the floor structures through the property, a mix of ground supported concrete floor slabs
and timber suspended floors were indicated. Resistance readings taken from the timber flooring
indicated a dry structure. With regard to the concrete floor slabs, the readings were indicative of slabs
pre-dating 1965 where the floor finishes are acting as the DPM to the slab construction (Section 2.1).
Observations made showed the exterior walls to be of cavity construction, with the cavities insulated
with retrofit blown insulation (Section 8.1). With regard to the possibility of weather driven penetrating
damp affecting the internal wall structures, this would be unlikely if the cavity structure is functioning
correctly as there should not be a capillary connection between the inner and outer leaf of the cavity
structure.
Observations and comments made by the tenant would point to issues with the ventilation of the
property (Section 7.0). On arrival to carry out the survey it was noted the windows to the property were
open front and back and is the opinion of the author this directly influenced the atmospheric readings
recorded.
It was noted laundry is being dried in the property mainly in a tumble dryer which is not vented to the
exterior (Section 8.2). It would be prudent for a sleeved vent point to be installed in the exterior wall to
the kitchen to allow correct venting of this unit. With regard to drying laundry outside, issues were
noted with the provision provided (Section 8.2), and the provision of an accessible clothes line would
also be prudent.
Based on the observations made it is the initial opinion of the author the mould activity affecting the
structure and contents is driven primarily by persistently high internal atmospheric moisture levels,
which are in turn driven by occupational activity and issues with the ventilation of the structure.
Clarification of suggested previous remedial works is required, combined with suggested invasive review
of the cavity wall structures to confirm they are not compromised.",1
0283_TN34.pdf,"The moisture survey undertaken through the property (Section 4.0) highlighted significant levels
affecting the structural elements in the primary loss area to the kitchen and adjoining bedroom area.
Moisture levels were noted sufficient to sustain a wide variety of timber decaying fungi. An inspection of
the loss affected areas (Section 6.0) confirmed at the time of the survey the timber structural elements
were not being affected by significant levels of fungal activity. Where noted, some strand samples were
collected for culturing and identification. It is recommended the loss affected timbers are treated to
limit possible timber decay and the affected area is dried.
The moisture survey through the rest of the property highlighted a number of additional areas which
displayed elevated moisture levels, including:
 Base of external wall to lounge area – rainwater penetration suggested and decorative failure
noted.
 External wall mid and high level to front bedroom 2 – rainwater penetration suggested close to
area adjacent to rain water hopper to the exterior.
 Both chimneys to North West facing elevation in bedroom 1 & 3.",0

At the time of survey, the RH controlled Swan EFHT25 100mm extractor in the kitchen was operating

0048_ME1.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) through the property and this in general
indicated a dry structure. However, a significant area of structural damp was noted focused on the
bathroom with an ingress from the flat above. Elevated moisture levels were indicated in the all
structural elements forming the ceiling, wall structures and the associated floor slab. It is recommended
checks are made in the flat above to understand if the suggested source of moisture is ongoing.
With regard to the reported and observed mould activity, it is the opinion of the author the main driver
is atmospheric moisture and, issues were identified with regard to the ventilation of the property.
Firstly, the bathroom does not benefit from an extractor fan and, is the primary source of atmospheric
in the property. Observations would suggest there has previously been additional ventilation in this area
possibly forced or passive (Section 6.1.2). With regard to the Kitchen, an extractor unit is installed
however issues were noted with regard to its installation and function which would likely impair its
effectiveness (Section 6.1.3).
The tenant is currently running dehumidifiers in an effect to control the atmospheric conditions and it is
likely the installed equipment is having a beneficial influence on the internal conditions.",3
0036_LU2.pdf,"The tenants have resided in the property for 18 years with no concerns reported for 15 of those years.
Mould began to develop to the external walls within the bedrooms to the front of the property three or
four years ago to the top of the walls and around the windows. The property is also reportedly difficult
to heat.
It was advised that due to the mould development within bedroom 1 the external walls were re-
plastered a few months prior to our attendance. The Council have attended on several occasions to wipe
surfaces to remove any mould present with the gutters also being cleared and, cavity wall insulation was
added three months ago as well as insulation being added to the loft prior to this.
Within bedroom 1 It is understood mould was an issue with this room being replastered however,
mould was noted to the UPVC window at the time of the survey and a single radiator under the window
had a bunk bed located in front of it. The trickle vent was open at the time of the survey but is in need of
a clean.
In bedroom 2 mould was noted on the TV (see section 6.2), on the UPVC window and on top of the
external wall. It is advised within the wardrobe mould was seen on to the clothing. The tenant appeared
to deploy moisture collectors within bedrooms 1 and 2 to aid the situation.
Mould also reportedly occurs within the bathroom at the top of the external wall however, at the time
of the survey no mould was sighted. A 100mm pull chord extraction unit was noted which emits a speed
of 1.1 m/s with no overrun after being switched off. This flow rate would achieve one complete air
change in 11 minutes after use.
Mould was also noted within bedroom 3 on the UPVC window (see section 6.3).
Three adults reside within the property with an additional two children staying every other week
Wednesday to Monday and two to three washing loads are processed via a tumble dryer with the back
door and window reportedly being open when in use.
A moisture profile of the property revealed a dry structure and a thermal survey located areas of cold
spots on the external walls to both bedrooms 1 and 2 (See sections 5.0 - 5.4). These tend to be focused
on the tops of walls where a lack of warm air flow and colder ceiling/wall junctions exist. A subsequent
inspection of the loft space revealed insulation which in areas does not appear to extend to the eaves
(section 6.4).
In conclusion no raised structural moisture levels were noted in the affected areas with it being the
surveyor’s opinion that mould development on surfaces and contents items is a result of a combination
of restricted airflow and elevated atmospheric conditions. To assist warming of the ceiling/wall areas, it
is recommended an inspection of the loft insulation is made to ensure all areas are adequately
protected.
Contents should be moved from the external walls and radiators within bedroom 1 and 3 to aid a
natural air circulation and reduce the possibility for cold spots on cooler exterior walls.",3
0017_E7.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the property involving invasive and non-invasive
readings and with regard to the wall structure, high moisture levels were indicated in many areas
affecting the base and lower wall structures (Section 4.3). In a number of areas drilled invasive readings
indicated a significant reduction in moisture levels compared to the surface readings (Section 4.4) and
the thermal survey undertaken (Section 5.0) indicated condensation was occurring or certainly was a
consideration through the majority of the property. The heating system was operating at the time of the
survey with the heating pipes running around the exterior walls having an influence on the lower wall
temperatures.
It is the opinion of the author, condensation is the likely driver for the raised moisture levels indicated in
many of the surveyed areas. However, with regard to the bathroom and associated wall to the kitchen,
high structural moisture levels were indicated migrating up the walls to a significant vertical height
suggesting a source of water affecting the structure. The heating system was shown to be holding
pressure plus a check of accessible plumbing failed to identify a leak (Section 7.3 & 7.4) and further
investigation is recommended.
With regard to the floor structure, observations would possibly suggest the property pre-dates 1965 in
which case the original floor finishes are likely to be acting as the DPM to the slab construction. Original
thermoplastic floor tiles were identified in the lounge cupboard which would be in line with a floor
structure pre-dating 1965 (Section 7.2).
As well as condensation issues, in properties pre-dating 1965 raised moisture levels noted to the base of
the walls can relate to as-built issues at the wall/floor junction where localized detailing allows ground
moisture in the floor slab etc. to migrate above the DPC. If this is the case, one of the main issues can be
incorrect detailing of the wall plaster. A localized invasive review of the wall/floor junction involving
removal of the skirting is normally sufficient to understand possible routes of moisture migration.
High atmospheric moisture levels were indicated in the property at the time of the survey and in fact,
based BS 5250:2002, the internal atmospheric conditions would indicate a ‘wet’ occupation (Section
4.1.1). The most likely driver for high atmospheric moisture levels in a property is occupational activity
normally in association with ineffective ventilation.
A review of the ventilation in the property identified recently installed and assumed to be humidity
controlled extractor fans in the kitchen and bathroom. Checks made would suggest these will be
effective in controlling the humidity in these areas (Section 6.2) and at the time of the survey the
average relative humidity in the property was 84.2 %RH. If the fan units are as suggested humidity
controlled, ideally they should have been running at the higher speed due to the humidity level. Checks
should be made with regard to the fan control and if possible, the units should speed up when the
humidity goes above 65 %RH. As part of the methods used to control the humidity in the property
effective ventilation is essential.",1
0250_TA6.pdf,"During my survey I took readings of the moisture levels in the surface of the wall and timber skirting
(WME) and at depth in the masonry (REL). The principal area I concentrated on was the bedroom as Mr
Rogers stated that they did not have any problems other than the bedroom. However, as a matter of
course I did take readings in the living room and checked the bathroom just in case, but no problems
were found in those areas.
Mr Rogers showed me a sample of the maggots that had been found in the bedroom and I also noted
that there were some dead maggots on the bedroom carpet. They appeared to be very small maggots,
were somewhat undeveloped and were in my opinion the same as those from small houseflies. I could
not find any point of ingress where they might be coming through the wall or floor. I therefore deduced
that the cause for this was not related to the damp. I suggested that Mr Rogers inspects his furniture
and bed thoroughly in case there was something within them where eggs had been laid and were
hatching out.
Mr Rogers showed me a sample of the removed foam underlay. This has clearly been wet for some
considerable time as the underlay was breaking down.
I took thermal images of the lower sections of the bedroom gable wall, both with the carpet down and
taken up. These images clearly show that there is a cold margin at the bottom of the wall that is at or
below dew point. This is very normal for a property of this age and construction and the fact that Mr and
Mrs Rogers sleep with the windows closed in the property for security is likely to cause raised moisture
levels within the atmosphere of the maisonette to such an extent that condensation will occur on the
cold margins of the property.
I noted that they had a wet room and a kitchen yet neither has any form of electro-mechanical
extraction systems to take moisture from cooking or bathing out of the property. I therefore
recommend that as this property has had retrofit cavity wall insulation and UPVC Windows and doors
that this should be fitted to combat the increase in atmospheric moisture levels that will occur when
these systems are fitted.
I took two readings of the atmosphere within the cavity wall on the gable end of the property. Both
readings showed that there was a propensity for condensation to occur within the matrix of the CWI and
wall. That if temperatures dropped lower enough then this will occur. In my opinion it is normal for this
to happen at the lower levels in the walls of older properties, but this can be combated by having good
heating and ventilation so that atmospheric moisture cannot become an issue.
In summary, it is my view that the condensation in this property is caused by occupational moisture
which is exacerbated by the fact that the occupants do not open their windows at night since the police
have advised them (as stated by Mr Rogers) to keep them shut. There are also no means of extracting
moisture out of the building by means of fans at times when they cannot keep windows open.
Mr and Mrs Rogers also have a tumble drier. Whilst this is a condensing type, there can be occasions if
this is not kept clean and the seals are perfect, such that moisture cannot leak into the air. They
apparently use this 3 to 4 times per week. The addition of a Humidistat controlled extractor to the
property might well combat any problems that this might inadvertently create.",1
0074_RH19.pdf,"Initial inspection:
A moisture survey undertaken with regard to the structure (Section 4.0) indicated significantly high
structural moisture levels with regard to a number of areas through the property in particular the gable
end wall.
We understand the retrofit cavity wall insulation has been removed (Section 7.1) from the gable end
wall and a thermal survey carried out indicated a blotchy pattern of surface temperatures across the
elevation and could relate to residual insulation in the cavity or the elevated structural moisture
recorded.
Further investigations are required to allow a clear understanding of the high structural moisture levels
recorded.
Checks were made with regard to the new extractor fans installed in the Bathroom and Kitchen areas
and observations would suggest they will be effective in controlling the atmospheric moisture levels in
these areas.",1
0056_NG17.pdf,"Entry is straight into the main shop/salon area with no evidence of decay or damage with the premises having been
used as a hairdressing academy with internal rooms constructed of timber stud and plasterboard.
To the rear of the property was clear extreme mould contamination to walls and ceiling surfaces, with the author
noting a concrete ceiling. A forced air extraction unit mounted on the wall at high level vents to the exterior operated
by a pull cord and was running at the time of arrival. The 100mm dia fan recorded a hooded flow rate of 1.4m/s in a
room 48.608cubic meters in size which is closed off to all other rooms being below the recommended flow rate.
Further inspection revealed open wall vents which were clear of debris however a thermal survey check also
confirmed the entire area demonstrated consistent low temperatures that would be expected with open passive
plates.
To the rear is a toilet which has a decorative artex ceiling finish and is coming away from the structure hence, a
sample was taken for ACM analysis, the results of which have been deemed ‘Negative’.
Moisture readings suggested all areas were dry apart from the rear mould contaminated room being a single storey
elevation with a flat roof. Access was permitted to the flat roof revealing various defects including small areas of
joint lifting, gaps within the roof to the wall junction and weeds growing in the felt. These would all allow water
ingress to the room below which is where the saturated ceiling and wall are, along with the mould contamination.
A full flat roof survey is recommended followed by mould remediation and a focused drying regime once the roof
and drainage have been assessed and/or repaired alongside ventilation upgrades to manage the internal
atmosphere that could also be affecting this room.

0102_BN17.pdf,"A moisture survey was undertaken at the property and the readings taken indicated the property was
dry with the exception of elevated readings from the bathroom sub-floor extending to location P in
bedroom 1.
A leak in the bathroom in early 2015 appears to only have been surface dried as the insulation below is
still wet (section 6.1). A non-permeable membrane below the insulation and screed on the block and
beam floor will trap moisture from the previous reported incident and is the authors opinion that a
programme of injection drying will be required to remedy the wet floor prior to full reinstatement of the
bathroom.
We understand one adult and two young children normally reside at the property and previous
atmospheric monitoring suggests the internal atmosphere has been recorded as high over the
monitoring period (see section 8.0).
With regard to existing ventilation measures, all windows have trickle vents at the head of the frame
and were open at the time of survey. In addition a passive vent was noted to the wall in bedroom 1.
There was no forced extraction unit fitted in the kitchen and the unit in the bathroom could not be
tested for its effectiveness due to the absence of electrics in the property at the time of the survey.
A tumble dryer located in the kitchen had a flexible outlet hose connected to it and will rely on manual
intervention to ensure it is vented to the exterior when in use (section 6.6).
During the survey, the tenant advised of mould on clothes in the cupboard in bedroom 2 and is
indicative of heightened atmospheric conditions within the property during occupancy.
A combination of an elevated internal moisture source and occupational conditions are likely to have
contributed to the outbreaks of mould in the property.
In addition, when the property was occupied the atmospheric conditions were monitored over a period
defined in section 8.0 and, under protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of
condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation being classified as ‘WET’ during this period.",3

Detailed moisture readings suggest the structure to be dry.
Due to the reported issues over the last eight years which according to the tenant is mainly during the
colder months, whilst at time of visit very little mould was noted and the structure appears to be dry, it
is recommended that a further visit is made after the summer.
There clearly are issues relating to the cavity at base level in the lounge and the possibility of interstitial
condensation developing especially that there is only a 5 degree difference between the temperature
and dew point.
It is recommended that RH controlled extraction units be fitted in the bathroom and kitchen as soon as
possible.

Trickle vents are fitted to the windows though were in a poor condition and not used at the time of the
survey.
We note a 100mm diameter forced vent fitted to the bathroom ceiling operates via the light pull cord. A
flow rate of 0.6 m/s was recorded with an overrun of 5 minutes. This equates to 4.71 litres l/s which is
below the recommended 15 l/s, with an overrun of 15 minutes after being switched off.
No external vent in the roof was noted which indicates condensation from the bathroom is possibly
being expelled into the roof void and not externally to the property.
The door thresholds are noted to be at external floor level also and may be allowing some localised
water ingress into the ground supported slab giving elevated readings around the doors. High REL
readings on the floor may be indicating expected ground moisture in the slab below the DPM.
In the wet room areas of inadequate flooring detail will allow moisture to penetrate the building fabric
during and after use, also some low level wall tiles have blown due to cracks and moisture ingress.
In conclusion it is the authors opinion there are slightly raised moisture levels around the base of the
walls and skirtings as a result of atmospheric conditions but any sources of moisture ingress in the
bathroom and around the outer doors to the property will add to localised high readings.",1

Scope
Following instruction from ……………………, attend the above property to report on current moisture
conditions. Plus investigate the cause or causes for the reported elevated structural moisture and
associated mould growth.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a modern ground floor flat in a purpose-
built block of cavity wall construction plasterboard dry-
lined to the interior. The floor structure through the
property and associated areas is a concrete block and
beam floor constructed over a ventilated void.
2.0 Incident:
We understand damp and associated mould is affecting
the property in a number of areas and, as well as the
structure, the owners’ contents are also significantly
affected.
In addition to the property itself, the associated communal entrance hallway is also reported as being
affected. Mr. Higgs and his family are currently in alternative accommodation.
3.0 Conclusion – 19th December 2022:
A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating elevated readings in regard to
the exposed floor slab to bedroom 2 in areas 1 & 2 on the survey and, it should be noted condensation
was shown to be an issue at the time of the survey (Section 5.0) in these areas which will likely have
significant influence on the recorded readings. In general, a dry condition was indicated to the wall
structures, however elevated resistance readings were highlighted to the base of the surveyed walls
and, at the time of the survey, atmospheric conditions and the thermal survey (Section 5.0) showed
condensation was a consideration in these areas.
It is the opinion of the author, atmospheric moisture conditions in the property are a consideration in
regard to the mould activity. In general this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the
effectiveness of the installed ventilation with air and surface temperatures also having an influence.
With regard to the atmospheric conditions at the time of the survey, moderately low air temperatures
were recorded in and around 16°C such that, if the air temperature was increased to 20°C in bedroom 1,
the relative humidity would drop to 56.2%RH.
Regarding current ventilation provisions (Section 6.1), the survey shows, the property does not meet the
requirements detailed in the Building regulations – Approved document F – Effective from 2010 with
issues highlighted in regard to:
 Effective forced ventilation of the bathroom and kitchen.
 The provision to meet the ‘Whole Dwelling Ventilation Rate’ based on passive ventilation and,
 Air transfer provision through the property (undercuts to doors).
Approved document F – 2010 has been updated to Approved Document F - 2021 Edition and, the latest
document has a higher requirement when considering the ‘Whole Dwelling Ventilation Rates’ via passive
ventilation trickle vents.
3.1 Recommendations:
It is recommended further survey works are carried out including:
Further understanding the moisture condition of the structure:
 Carry out gravimetric analysis of the floor slab involving the laboratory analysis of an invasive
sample collect from the slab to determine the moisture content percentage by weight inclusive
of free capillary moisture and hygroscopic moisture.
 Review the wall/floor junction to detail the relationship the floor and the plasterboard to the
wall structures.
 Re-record moisture conditions through the property after the dwelling has been warmed to
20°C for a period of time.
Allow a clear understanding of the ventilation requirements:
 Gain access to the ventilation check list and commissioning certificate to demonstrate
compliance with approved document F (for example those contained in the domestic ventilation
compliance guide). This documentation should have been provided as part of the building
control approval process.
 Gain access to the permeability test results most likely undertaken by the developer or, carry
out a Pulse Test on the dwelling to confirm the property’s natural permeability providing an
understanding of the ventilation requirements and standards compliance required.
3.1 Gravimetric analysis – 3rd February 2023:
Gravimetric analysis has been carried out in regard to the floor screed to bedroom 2 (Section 4.3) and,
indicated a dry condition free from capillary moisture.
However, the analysis did indicate a significantly high alkaline level (Section 4.3.1) and may well be
driving the elevated readings indicated on the electronic meters used on site.
3.2 Humidity box readings and further wall moisture readings – 28th February 2023:
Humidity box readings have been taken as specified for the wood flooring industry which indicated a dry
condition in regard to the floor screed in bedroom 2 survey location 1. (Section 4.5).
Repeated wall moisture readings in general indicated a reduced moisture with warmer internal air
temperatures at the time of the return visit. (Section 4.1.1).

The box is bonded to the surface of the screed for 72
hours whereby moisture in the screed wets the sample air
in the box recess until equilibrium is achieved. This
method of gauging the moisture condition of the screed is
utilised by many flooring industries with the test carried
out using the protocols detailed in BS8201:2011 Code of
practice for installation of flooring of wood and wood-
based panels, which requires a resultant equilibrium
relative humidity at or below 75%ERH at an ambient in-door air temperature (20⁰C).

5.0 Thermal survey:
5.1 Bedroom 2 – Location 1:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within the survey area was 9.8⁰C plus, the spot
temperature to the surface of the floor slab under the
carpet was 10.6°C. The calculated dew point temperature
was 11.0⁰C and, condensation was a consideration in
regard to the surface of the slab.
5.2 Bedroom 2 – Location 2:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within this survey area was 9.8⁰C plus, the spot
temperature to the surface of the floor slab under the
carpet was 10.5°C. The calculated dew point temperature
was 11.0⁰C and condensation was also a consideration in
regards to the surface of the slab in this area.
5.2.1 Bedroom 2 – Location 1 – 28th February 2023:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within this survey area was 12.2⁰C this being the surface
of the screed. In regard to the base of the wall at survey
location ‘A’, the surface temperature was 15.8°C. The
calculated dew point temperature was 11.4⁰C and
condensation was not occurring at the time of the survey
but may have been an issue earlier in the day.
5.3 Bedroom 2 – Location B - A:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within this survey area was 13.2⁰C and the spot
temperature to the surface of the plasterboard to the
base of the dry-lining was 15.1°C. The calculated dew
point temperature was 11.0⁰C. with the readings
suggesting condensation was not an issue to the surfaces
above the floor slab in this area.
5.4 Bedroom 1 – Location G:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within this survey area was 8.7⁰C this being the base of
the exterior wall. The calculated dew point temperature
was 11.0⁰C and, readings would indicate condensation
was indeed occurring in this area at the time of the
survey.
5.5 Communal Hallway – Location O - R:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface temperature
within the survey area was 8.8⁰C this being the stairs. The
spot temperature to the surface of the plasterboard just
above the stairs was 10.9°C and the calculated dew point
temperature was 8.6⁰C. The readings would indicate
condensation was not occurring in this area at the time of
the survey.
6.0 Observations and relevant information:
6.1 Ventilation:
6.1.1 Passive ventilation:
It was noted uPVC windows with trickle vents are
installed through the property and in general, the
windows were closed with a number of the trickle vents
open.
Approximate open area of trickle vents = 28900mm2
With regard to the trickle vents, many are obstructed by
the installed blinds.
6.1.2 Forced ventilation to the Bathroom:
The ceiling mounted intermittent running fan unit is
controlled via the light function with no overrun after use.
On test the following rates were recorded:
Standard:
Air speed: 2.78 m/sec.
Time per air change 12.24 minutes
6.1.4 Make-up air flow into bathroom:
To ensure extractor fan units are effective, make-up air
must be able to flow freely into the ventilated area plus,
undercuts to all the doors through the property are
required to allow the free-flow of background ventilation.
To this end Part F of the Building Regulations requires a
gap of 10mm and, observation show the undercut needs
to be increased with it likely to be a consistent issue
through the property.
6.1.5 Forced ventilation Kitchen area:
The manually operated intermittent fan unit is a manual
operation with no overrun after use and emitted the
following flow rates on test:
Air speed: 2.37 m/sec.
Time per air change 15 minutes Kitchen area
63 minutes entire room
6.1.6 Property ventilation:
As detailed in the building regulations – Approved document F – Effective from 2010.
Intermittent fan required flow rates are:
Bathroom 15 Litres/second
Kitchen 30 Litres/second adjacent to the hob.
60 Litres/Second elsewhere
In addition to ventilating the kitchen and bathroom there is also a requirement to achieve the ‘Whole
Dwelling Ventilation Rate’ and, in the case of intermittent fan units this is achieved by the natural
ventilation through the trickle vents etc. In the case of the surveyed property a total open surface area
of the passive ventilation should be at least 30000mm2 set for properties leakier than 5m3/(h.m2) at 50
Pa.
Possible option - Continuous running fans with boost function:
Required boost function flow rates
Bathroom 8 Litres/second
Kitchen 13 Litres/second
As mentioned, to achieve the ‘Whole Dwelling Ventilation Rate’, in the case of continuous running fans
with boost functions this is covered by the continuous running rate of the installed fan units combined.
Which in regard to the surveyed property is 20.1 Litres/Sec based on the floor area.
It was noted in the case of Ø100mm fan units, air flow rates above 8 Litres/Sec. at this diameter can
start to generate noticeable noise levels leading to units being switched off when being run continually.
If the ventilation system is to be upgraded, it would be prudent to install a Ø150mm unit is the Kitchen.
6.2 Mould activity:
Mould is affecting contents as well as the structure and,
as well as the pictured furniture, contents in the drawers
are also affected. With regard to affected contents it is
atmospheric moisture conditions which allows mould to
develop and proliferate on such items.
The main driver which allows moulds to develop and
flourish in and on the materials within a structure is
moisture or, to be precise, water activity. Materials can
become damp in a number of ways, directly being
wetted, moisture penetrating materials through capillary
action, physical contact and hygroscopic materials
absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere.
There are many hundreds of mould varieties each
requiring different levels of water activity to allow them
to develop and flourish. The lowest known level of water
activity at which mould can be active is 0.61. In general,
this level collates to an atmospheric relative humidity
(RH) of 61%. Condensation does not have to form on a
surface. For there to be sufficient moisture to allow mould to become established at the point where
condensation occurs, the relative humidity will be 100%.
Moulds are simple fungi from several groupings in the fungal classification system. Sexual reproduction
in some fungi allows genetic modification to adapt and tolerate changes in the environment such as
humidity, temperature, and food requirements.
There are three principal features common to the broad range of mould:
1. Simple food requirements: able to exist on non-nutrient materials such as plaster and brick
which have traces of contaminating organic matter.
2. Produce vast number of spores which allow rapid adaptation to particular environments
conditions and rapid colonization of other suitable locations within an enclosed environment.
3. Grow very quickly under suitable conditions. The main requirement for the development and
growth is a source of moisture although food, oxygen and a suitable temperature are also
important.
Moulds can be regarded as hydrophilic fungi (tolerating high water availability) although individual
species have their own optimum requirements for moisture. In most situations where surface
condensation occurs and or the relative humidity of the internal atmosphere exceeds 70% (0.7 aw) for
an extended period, mould growth will be established.
Mould is opportunist and once established in a property will quickly colonize areas with appropriate
conditions. Most properties through their normal occupational cycle will have periods of high
occupational moisture however, it is the prolonged periods which will allow mould to develop. Once
mould is present in a structure the period of time it will take to colonize new areas is reduced due to
the increased level of spores being produced in an enclosed area. In many cases a process of mould
removal is required to allow a satisfactory outcome to change in occupational activity when trying to
prevent further mould activity.
7.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on non-wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics.
Tramex CMEX11 (Concrete encounter meter) using electrical impedance survey method the meter is
calibrated to indicate % moisture content by weight in concrete floor slabs and anhydrite screeds.
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However, for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.

0051_ME2.pdf,"Mould was noted mainly on wall and ceiling surfaces in the bathroom and kitchen and, a non-invasive moisture profile was undertaken
throughout the flat which revealed a dry structure.
In regard to how the flat is ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen plus, trickle vents to the
windows.
In accordance with BS 5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in
occupied buildings; a “wet” occupancy is calculated. In Addition, the thermal survey confirmed condensation was occurring and conditions at wall
surfaces were as such that mould is able to be sustained.
In conclusion, the issues raised by the tenant’s carer are in the opinion of the author, associated with periods of elevated internal humidity levels
and inadequate ventilation supported by a recorded dry structure, underperforming extraction units and impaired background trickle vents all
aligning to the BS5250:2002 calculation. It is recommended the extraction units are checked for compliance alongside door undercuts plus, the
trickle vent conditions are improved alongside supported guidance for the occupant regarding their use. One option could be to consider
continuous running extract units in order to make the atmospheric management more easier.

0025_GU9.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) this highlighted in general a dry structure
certainly this was the case in the area highlighted by the tenant as being areas suffering from persistent
mould activity. In regard to the kitchen floor elevated readings were noted through the decorative vinyl
floor, these most likely relate to a previous plumbing issues under the sink.
With regard to the majority of areas being affected by persistent mould activity it is the opinion of the
author atmospheric conditions are the main driver. This being elevated internal atmospheric conditions
combined with cooler surfaces temperatures leadings to resultant persistent elevated relative humidity
levels and associated mould growth.
The survey did highlight significant issues with regard to the forced ventilation in the property (Section
6.1), with issues noted in regard to both the bathroom and the kitchen area ventilation.
As regard to cooler wall temperature and cooler temperatures in the property in general, it was made
clear by the tenant they tend not to use the installed electric heating ‘as this costs too much to run’.",3
0292_W11.pdf,"The moisture survey of the entire floor indicated elevated readings in all rooms with the exception of
the bathroom (Section 4.2). Invasive drilled readings recorded at depth into the wall structure backed up
the readings taken (Section 4.3).
Issues with the ventilation of the property were noted (Section 5), mainly that the extractor fan in the
bathroom is not as effective as it could be and that the kitchen extractor fan does not have overrun.
Passive vents are evident, being aligned internally with external vents, with two noticeably blocked, one
in the hall, the other above the window on the outside east wall. The windows are mainly single pane
sash windows that do not have the benefit of trickle vents, which at the time of the survey were not
open and had mould growth on the frames.
External observations indicated the DPC was visible in a short section of brickwork on the north-east
corner of the building, approximately 1½ courses above ground level (Section 6.1). It was not visible in
any other part of the building at this level, being covered by either repointed mortar, paint or render.
Observation suggests the DPC may be compromised; invasive readings at locations B, E and G1 indicates
moisture at depth in outside-facing solid brick walls.
The tenant has claimed water ingress around the windows to the two rooms at the rear of the property
(living room and bedroom 2). Measurements of elevated readings to the full height of the walls, one in
each room near the windows, were made in the corner equivalent to the location of the downpipes on
the outside walls, though there was no evidence of ingress at the time of the survey. However, the walls
were exhibiting patches of mould and damp (living room), cracks and dried drip marks (bedroom 2), with
the floor covering in the living room lifting at location E/F (Section 6.2). Further, the party wall to the
living room and bedroom 2 showed elevated readings, supported by high invasive drilled readings at
location H.
External wall penetrations in the vicinity of the windows were noted (Section 6.3). None could be
visually determined as a source for leaks at these locations. An ongoing water issue from height on the
east wall was observed however, apparently wetting the common wall between 14 and 16 Leamington
Road Villas (Section 6.4).
The scullery off the kitchen is notable for evident damp patches and mould growth to the south, west
and north facing walls (Section 6.5.1). Supported by invasive readings, consistently high measurements
were taken, particularly to the west facing wall. This room is situated below the outside stairs leading to
the apartments above, evident by a small section of sloping ceiling, which also revealed high moisture
readings. There are no windows in this room and air extraction is negligible with no discernable
movement in the one passive ceiling vent.
A cupboard door on the west wall in the scullery that may have revealed structural damp proofing in this
area was locked off, even to the tenant. External examination of the stairs and path to the north wall
revealed a painted area with air vent, though no discernable damp proofing techniques (Section 6.5.2).
On the south side is a garden and retaining wall butting up to the scullery wall. Examination of this area
revealed large holes under the path and stairs (Section 6.5.3).
The south wall of the scullery forms a junction with the kitchen and bedroom 1 (Section 4.1). Readings
in these areas suggest elevated moisture levels across this junction at locations (Y, A1, B1 and E1).
Examination of the associated external walls shows the walls to be rendered and therefore does not
reveal a discernable damp proofing system (Section 6.5.4).
In bedroom 1, an elevated reading was made along the outside facing west wall at location W, the point
at which the water supply enters the property. An external examination of the pipe reveals it is severely
corroded and may require maintenance (Section 6.6). Further, the concrete in the sub-ground level
patio outside the window of the bedroom is broken with plant growth, rubbish and leaves littering the
floor, reducing the efficiency of the drainage system.
The tenant expressed concern the large tree in the back garden may be a cause of some of the moisture
ingress into the rear of the property. Though there appears to be some movement in the pavers
(Section 6.7), any effects the root system may have had on the property can only be determined by
invasive works around the base of the building.
Several factors appear to be contributing to the issues being experienced in this property. Readings
taken in the areas of the living room and bedroom 1, as well as in and around the scullery suggests
moisture within the structure. There are also issues with ventilation, which with the presence of one
adult and two children will raise the moisture load in the property and thus the opportunity for mould to
develop.",1
0161_LU2.pdf,"Based on the moisture survey (section 5.0) the primary area of concern is to the external wall/ceiling
area in bedroom 1 and was reported by Mr Faraz to have suffered water damage from a chimney which
has subsequently been removed.
High moisture readings recorded at survey locations B, C and D in the bedrooms would suggest the
insulated cavity has likely become wet in this area and drilled readings at locations B and C confirm the
inner brick and cavity insulation are significantly wet. A thermal image (section 7.1) indicates a cold wall
and would align to the drilled moisture levels recorded in the location.
Localised mould to the bedroom ceiling above the ceiling fan (section 6.2) aligns to a gap in the
mechanism whereby air expels onto this area and, a gap in thermal efficiency of the loft insulation could
be allowing the mould to develop.
Raised moisture readings at survey locations M, N and P all appeared localized to those areas and may
be related to the performance of the slate DPC.
During the survey from an atmospheric moisture perspective, issues were noted with the control of the
forced ventilation to the bathroom and the kitchen whereby both extractors were switched off at the
isolator at the time of the survey. On test, the bathroom unit emitted a low flow rate but recognize the
unit is humidity controlled. The extractor unit in the kitchen was not working and all the trickle vents
were closed at the time of the survey. A lack of adequate ventilation in a property will exacerbate areas
of cold and damp potentially leading to the onset of mould development.",1

Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a large detached dwelling constructed
over 3 floors of modern insulated cavity wall construction.
2.0 Incident:
Localized area of damp to central stairwell, cause not
confirmed. Originally thought to be caused by loss water
entering the structure at the tiled roof level and draining
down through the property to the loss area via the SVP,
which is located in the loss affected area of the structure.
Water damage is reported to be associated with rainfall.
3.0 Instruction:
Re-attend the property to carry out an invasive investigation to determine the source of the moisture
affecting the structure.
4.0 Conclusions:
Previous works undertaken by the home owner:
Mr. Ostler originally had a tradesman attend the property and carry out repairs to the roof which he felt
addressed the water ingress issues. It was felt by Mr. Ostler conditions in the property had improved.
moisture levels so that the loss affected area could be monitored. The first visit was carried out on the
5th February 2014 with a follow up visit undertaken on the 16th April. Moisture readings and thermal
images recorded showed the loss affected areas to have reduced in moisture level. However, following a
period of significant rain fall the damp area was reported to have returned. Consequently the property
was re-attended on the 9th July 2015 when raised moisture levels were clearly evident.
Invasive investigation:
The investigation showed it is very unlikely the loss moisture affecting the structure is not water ingress
from the exterior (Section 5.3.4).
The bathroom and dressing room adjoining the loss affected area were assessed; these areas were
found to be dry. An issue with pressure loss in the heating system was highlighted. The system was
topped up and monitored by Mr. Ostler and found not to be an issue. Further investigations are required
to resolve the source of the loss moisture, the bricked void needs to be accessed as part of these
investigations.
5.0 Observations:
Invasive investigation:
5.1 Thermal and moisture survey:
At the time of the invasive survey the area of damp was
significant, as clearly shown by the thermal image
recorded. Moisture readings recorded back up the
images.
5.2 Floor plan:
Dress room to master Bricked void
bedroom
Loss affected area
SVP taking waste
water from bathroom
and en-suite
5.3 Invasive investigations to be undertaken:
Access the built in structures in the bathroom area and dressing room to the master bedroom to allow
the plumbed systems in the property to be clearly understood in relation to the loss affected area.
Access to the loft area will also be required to allow suggested water ingress to be assessed.
5.3.1 Dressing room to master bedroom:
The built in wardrobes to the dressing room were
dismantled and the wall structure accessed. The plumbed
services running through this area were found to be in
good order and the area was shown to be dry.
5.3.2 The boxed areas to the bathroom:
The boxed areas were accessed and the plumbing was
found to be dry, as pictured. The connection for the toilet
in this area is below the pictured floor level. It is the
opinion of the author the toilet waste connection to the
soil stack is not leaking due to the fact this would tend to
affect the ceiling to the kitchen area below which is dry.
5.3.3 Heating system:
It was noted there was no pressure in the underfloor
heating system running through the first floor area. The
system was topped up and left running. Mr. Ostler was
going to monitor the system as instructed. It has been
confirmed since the pressure has not dropped which
would tend to suggest the heating system is not at fault.
5.3.4 Water ingress from roof structure:
A review of the structure would suggest the loss is
affecting the bricked void to the first floor landing
adjacent to the dressing room to the master bedroom.
The bricked void does not extend above the first floor
level and a review of the loft area confirmed the soil stack
to the bathroom does not extend through the loft to vent
to the exterior. The soil stack to the bathroom is likely to
be fitted with an air admittance valve. The pictured pipe is
one of the flues to the boilers.",0

Initial visit: 29th September 2015

Scope
Following instruction from ……………., attend the above property to report on continued damp issues
affecting the rear extension to the property.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a large detached dwelling reported to date
from 1903 of solid brick construction to original areas and
timber suspended floors.
A modern rear extension has been added to the property
this is a single storey flat roof structure reported to be
cavity wall construction which is rendered and decorated
to the exterior. A concrete ground supported floor slab is
installed through the lower areas to the rear of the
property encompassing the kitchen area to the original
structure and the new rear extension.
2.0 Incident:
There are a number of areas of damp leading to
decorative failure affecting the exterior walls to the rear
modern extension area. It is reported various damp
remediation works have previously been under taken
however the areas of concern still persist.
Line of injected DPC
Evidence of a chemical injected DPC was noted around
the base of the external walls to the extension.
3.0 Conclusion – 29th September:
Three main areas of concern indicated by failure of the decorative finishes were pointed out by the
owner of the property. The moisture survey carried out confirmed high structural readings in the
indicated areas.
Invasive investigation – 15th October:
The invasive investigation (Section 5.4) identified the DPC to the wall structure being above the internal
floor level with solid thermalite block work below the DPC and an insulated cavity wall above. The lower
wall structure relies on the internal render to provide a dry non-spoiling inner surface. This has been
compromised at the three noted areas - window opening, door opening and transition between new
and old structures. It is the opinion of the author the as-built detail is weak however in general appears
to be functioning correctly. The insulated cavity above the DPC appeared to be in good order however
the detail would be prone to bridging of the cavity above the DPC between the outer and inner leaves. It
would be prudent for the cavity to be inspected at the three areas of concern as part of the remedial
works.

5.0 Observations – Areas of concern:
5.1 Wall structure associated with window – location A:
Area of water damage which suggested water ingress and
possible compromised wall cavity. Affected area is across
and the under underside of the window and to the left
hand side of the window as viewed and extending up the
wall approximately height of 400mm.
5.2 Patio doors – survey location E:
Loss affected wall area noted to the left hand side of patio
doors with minor water damage noted to the decorative
timber flooring.
5.3 Rear extension – survey location J:
An area of damp was noted to the junction between the
original brick wall structure and the new cavity wall to the
rear extension.
5.4 Invasive investigation 15th October:
Survey location A:
The skirting and wall finishes were removed in a
controlled manner and the wall structure accessed above
DPC
and below the identified DPC to allow a clear
understanding of the structure. The DPC in the wall is
located just below the top of the internal skirting 140mm
up from the finished floor level at the level of the bell cast
to the external render finish. Thermalite block work was
noted above and below the DPC and moisture readings
were recorded above and below the DPC.
Above 18.0 %WME
Below 90.7 %WME
The moisture readings recorded would suggest the DPC is functioning correctly with regard to the block
work, with the lower block work saturated and moderate levels indicated above the DPC. The render
and skim plaster bridge the DPC and it is assumed the render is designed to have damp inhibiting
characteristics to prevent damp in the lower block work affecting the internal decoration. The high
moisture levels indicated above the skirting at this location during the initial visit are in the render and
skim plaster.
It is the opinion of the author the as-built detail is weak, however appears in general to be functioning
correctly considering there are only three locations around the extension where issues have been noted.
The three areas where issues have been identified are all areas where there are opens or connections
between old and new structures.
5.4.1 Identified wall construction:
100mm thermalite block
Insulated cavity
Internal render and skim
Bell cast to render
DPC 140mm up from FFL
Ground level
Solid thermalite block work
Heavy gauge DPM terminated at FFL
Internal floor assumed to be insulated
5.4.2 Wall floor junction – survey location A:
The solid thermalite block work extends down below the
internal floor level the block work was saturated as
stated. Render finish applied to the internal surface above
the floor level. The blue heavy gauge DPM can be seen to
the edge of the floor screed terminating at the finished
floor level.
6.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on none wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.
Non-destructive Protimeter Surveymaster 200 REL(PS) or below in masonry guide only
Non-destructive Tramex MRH Masonry scale 40 REL(TM) or below in masonry guide only

0236_SW15.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated damp conditions with regard to the wall structures which
would be expected considering the basement is not tanked. With regard to the two flank walls to the
basement survey locations A & C, moderately low moisture levels were indicated at the top of the walls
above the level of the earth in the adjoining floor voids. With regard to the rear wall to the basement
the area of the reported loss high structural moisture levels were indicated to full height. Moderately
low moisture levels were noted at the survey locations to the floor slab (Section 4.2) which may well
indicate the presence of a DPM in the construction of the floor slab which was screeded and painted.
Due to the fact the basement is not tanked, the brick wall structures will be directly affected by the
varying ground water conditions which in turn will be influenced by the external weather conditions etc.
It was also noted there is a significant amount of plumbing running through the loss affected area
(Section 6.4) and it would be prudent to ensure there are no further ongoing leaks affecting this area
considering the period time which has elapsed since the loss.
Due to the indicated nature of the ventilation to the basement (Section 6.3), it is the opinion of the
author the atmospheric moisture conditions in the basement will be directly influenced by the
conditions under the timber suspended floors.
With regard to the previously suggested remedial works it was noted the highlighted services are
located at the top of the flank wall in the area of survey location ‘A’ in an area which displayed
moderately low structural moisture levels. It is the opinion of the author beneficial works should be able
to be carried out without the need to disturb these services. It should also be noted the main area of
concern is the rear wall be the basement.
Works to limit or prevent the evaporation of moisture from the walls will influence the atmospheric
conditions in the basement, however it is the opinion of the author raised atmospheric moisture levels
may well persist due to the nature of the basement ventilation.",0
0058_NW7.pdf,"Non-invasive moisture readings were recorded mainly in the bathroom and connecting bedroom which confirmed a
dry structure.
Regarding how the flat is ventilated, there is a working mechanical extraction unit fitted in the bathroom and a
cooker hood unit in the kitchen which produced a flow rate of 0.5 M/S on the highest setting.
Passive trickle vents were noted to the windows with most closed at the time of the survey. The mechanical
extraction units appear to extract to the exterior via the roof (see observations) however, their performance
requires checking along with the associated ducting to determine their efficient extraction to the exterior and, why
condensation is able to drip back down one of the ductings.
Within the atmospheric section a “wet” occupancy was calculated in accordance with BS5250:2002 Code of
practice for control of condensation in buildings: Annex B Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied buildings;
which will be driven by inadequate ventilation.
Internal observations revealed staining mainly on external wall surfaces in the bedroom connected to the bathroom
which in the opinion of the author, is likely to be consistent with periods of condensation. At the time of survey
water droplets (condensation) were noted dripping from the extraction unit in the bathroom and from the trickle vent
in the bedroom. Furthermore. there was clear evidence of mould mainly around window reveals (see observations)
which requires time constraints in order to develop. All outbreaks should be removed in order to reduce the
potential for outbreaks in other areas of the property due to the free circulation of excess numbers of spores.
In conclusion based upon a dry structure within the areas of concern and observations made especially within the
thermal imaging plus the ventilation measures, the concerns of the occupants are, in the opinion of the author,
likely to be attributed to periods of elevated internal humidity levels and inadequate ventilation.

0142_E7.pdf,"We understand two adults and two infants reside at the flat and the tenant has confirmed 3 - 4 washing
loads are processed per week and dried within the property.
At time of the survey, mould and condensation was noted on a number of surfaces and within the
lounge, mould was present mainly around the window frame and at base level by the door to the
balcony.
Within bedroom 1, clear decorative damage to the wallpaper and mould was present with further
growth noted on the uPVC door to the balcony. Condensation was observed to the window where the
curtains were noted to be drawn.
A moisture survey (section 5.0) was carried out through the flat and dry readings were obtained in most
areas. However, off-scale surface moisture levels were noted in the corner of the external wall in
bedroom 1 where clear decorative damage has occurred along with the development of mould as
indicated. A thermal image of this section highlighted clear cold areas and a drilled reading at 20mm
deep was taken recording a reading of 8.6 %WME. This low internal level could confirm the likely cause
to be condensation forming during the survey with a contributing factor being the double wardrobe
against the external wall in front of the uPVC door restricting air flow. A visual of the adjoining balcony
area did not reveal any obvious defects that may give rise to an ingress issue.
In the kitchen, slight mould was noted around the window and flaking paint and raised moisture levels
were recorded to upper and mid-level locations to the wall between the kitchen and bathroom (at
survey location point G).
A visual inspection of the access void revealed a possible leak to a service pipe in this location and
correlated with high moisture levels recorded in the adjoining bathroom to the same wall (section 8.6).
With regard to forced ventilation in the property, a 125mm diameter extraction unit in the kitchen
operates via a pull cord and on test gave a flow rate of 2.7 m/s. This equates to 33 l/s and is above the
current recommended flow rate if located adjacent to a hob but, is below the rate of 59 l/s when
located elsewhere. On testing the pull cord is used again to switch the unit off however, after
approximately 20 minutes the unit was still running and therefore, the isolator switch was used to shut
it down.
In the bathroom a 100mm diameter extraction unit operates via the light switch and gave flow rate of",3
0195_PO20.pdf,"A moisture profile was completed throughout the property which revealed elevated moisture levels to
external low level wall surfaces on the ground floor within both bedrooms and the lounge and, to the
bathroom floor to the first floor.
The elevated readings to the wall surfaces are likely to be attributed to a combination of condensation
issues as highlighted in the thermal survey (section 5.0) and, with a high drilled moisture reading
possible bridging of the DPC alongside compromised cavity wall insulation with
21a Picton House, Hussar Court, Westside View. Waterlooville, Hampshire PO7 7SQ
As to the elevated reading within the bathroom, this could relate to occupational use with a poor seal to
the bath however, an internal leak cannot be ruled out and should be investigated.
Regarding how the property is currently being ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units
in both the kitchen and the bathroom which require attention. In addition, there are trickle vents to the
windows however all were noted to be closed at the time of the survey. Some of the windows were
open which according to the tenant, is due to the condensation issues.
A common theme throughout the property was the amount of contents in front of external wall surfaces
to such an extent that condensation was an issue and recorded humidity levels at the time were at
sufficient levels to sustain a variety of moulds highlighted by the thermal survey (section 5.0).
External observations revealed a number of issues which included possible bridging of the non-visual
DPC, a very limited number of air vents which were partly blocked, downpipes not connected and,
broken or missing roof tiles.",1
0093_TN39.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating a dry structure and would suggest
the reported mould activity is driven by elevated atmospheric moisture levels.
The mould is affecting the inclined section of ceiling to the bathroom which is common for this type of
construction detail to be colder due to issues around effective insulation and, was confirmed by the
thermal survey (Section 5.1).
Atmospheric moisture levels in conjunction with cold surfaces produce resultant elevated relative
humidity (%RH) which in turn drive mould growth.
It was confirmed by the tenant the fan units in the bathroom and kitchen had been installed in late
October. The flow rates were checked (Section 6.1.2 & 6.1.3) and indicated the installed units meet the
requirement detailed in part ‘F’ of the building regulations (Section 6.1.5) including the requirement for
‘Whole dwelling ventilation rate’ which was 19.7 Litres/Sec.
The tenant confirmed the highlighted mould had developed prior to the fan units being installed and was
not treated as part of the works carried out, believing the mould has developed whilst the new fans have
been in the property.
Considering a dry condition of the property and the indicated fan operations being compliant with the
building regulations, it would be prudent to treat areas in the property affected by mould and possibly
consider the application of a mould inhibiting paint system in these areas.",3
0210_RM13.pdf,"Five adults and one child reside at the property, with one adult and the child usually in residence during
the day. We are advised there are 14 – 15 washing loads processed per week which are dried using a
mini tumble dryer. We are further advised when a cycle is complete the unit is moved approximately 3
metres to the kitchen sink with a flexi hose used out of the window to dispel the moisture.
A detailed moisture survey carried out revealed the structure to be dry (see Section 5.0). With regard to
ventilation of the internal atmosphere, there are a number of roof vents noted along with a passive vent
in the ground floor bedroom. At the time of the survey all windows and trickle vents were closed.
The 100mm extraction unit within the kitchen was constantly running at the time of the survey.
However, when using the pull cord, it was not able to enter the ‘boost’ mode. The cord appears to be
trapped to the side of the unit (see Section 6.1). A flow rate of 0.6m/s was recorded which equates to
4.71l/s and is therefore below the recommended 29l/s when adjacent to the hob and 59l/s when
elsewhere.
The 100mm extraction unit in the bathroom (section 6.7) has no overrun when turned off via the pull
cord. A flow rate of 3.6m/s was recorded which equates to 28.28l/s and is therefore a sufficient flow for
this environment. However, an overrun of 15 minutes is recommended to ensure an adequate air
change following use.
At the time of the survey no mould was noted to any of the reported areas. However, we are advised all
areas had recently been cleaned.
A visual inspection of the exterior was undertaken and the DPC could not be seen as it appears to be
covered with a concrete render profile around the perimeter (see Section 6.2) which may be bridging
the DPC.
It is the opinion of the author that internal atmospheric conditions are the likely cause of issues being
faced within the property. These are encouraged by inadequate ventilation to the kitchen area, a lack of
an overrun to the bathroom ventilation and the drying of clothes within the property.",3
0001_BN17.pdf,"On arrival, the author was advised by a relative of the
resident (who was at work) the concerns aligns to
dampness being observed in areas of the property with
stale odours also detected at times. On arrival the property appeared to be in general good order although
some areas did display localised spoiling likely due to the overriding condition of the structure.
A moisture profile was conducted through the property in order to assist determining a pattern through
the dwelling as a whole and not just singular aspects (section 4.0).
The readings were elevated in many areas both to internal and external walls. The floor also emitted
elevated readings where was possible to the thermoplastic floor tiling and, can be considered a normal
phenomena since the tiling will be acting as a DPM for ground moisture in the slab.
However, a review of exposed floor areas indicated a number of gaps in the membrane and even some
tiles removed resulting in a clear observation of the residual bitumen. This absence of a DPM will enable
ground moisture to evaporate into the structure raising the potential for secondary issues. And, as it was
notable in a number of areas, it remains highly likely why some areas of the installed timber floor also
emitted elevated moisture readings.
With this in mind, there remains a feasible problem with the membrane coverage as whole in the property
resulting in the elevated readings obtained throughout. Also, in some areas the skirtings emitted elevated
moisture levels and could likely be due to their contact with the ground or through the localised walls
where they may be in contact with the concrete slab.
To the exterior there was evidence of cavity wall insulation (CWI) with a number of drill holes noted and,
what cannot be ruled out from the external wall perspective is the overall condition of the CWI in terms
of its dampness as this can also act as a bridge for moisture to travel to the inner leaf and wet the internal
walls.
Whilst on site an assessment was undertaken of the installed ventilation measures with forced extractors
installed in the bathroom and kitchen as this can also impact the internal conditions particularly in the
colder periods of the year. Of note, trickle vents were installed in these rooms also and, they can also
compromise the extractor performance by being able to draw air in from the exterior rather than from the
rooms.
A test of the bathroom extractor suggested it’s flow rate is compatible with the Part F of the Building Regs
when on boost and a secondary boost function which is manually selected. However, for its optimum
performance delivery it is recommended guidance is given to the tenant to keep the nearby window closed
when this is operating for it to withdraw moist air from the property and not draw air in and straight out
from the exterior. In addition, Part F of the Building Regs suggest a 10mm door undercut to enable ‘make-
up’ air to be drawn into the bathroom from the dwelling and expel all moist air to the exterior. This door
did not comply with the recommendations and hence, after the room is used, the difference in vapour
pressure will result in the warm moist atmosphere circulating the property.
In the kitchen the wall mounted device was switched off at the isolator and the tested flow rate was not
compliant with the applicable regs. Also, with a variable door undercut, using the kitchen will also likely
encourage atmospheric moisture to circulate the dwelling raising the potential for secondary issues.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, there are indeed elevated moisture readings to the majority
of the external and internal lower walls and, with notable gaps in the thermoplastic membrane acting as
a DPM for ground moisture, the ongoing presence of ground moisture is a likely contributor to the
reported damp related issues. This was endorsed by expected high readings taken on the exposed floor
confirming its construction hence, it is recommended the floor covering as a whole is checked alongside
the removal of all skirtings to assess the presence of a membrane to the lower wall from the floor. The
introduction of a liquid DPM cannot be ruled out as a possible option to reduce this issue.
In addition, the presence and condition of the CWI should be checked to ensure this is not a contributory
factor also to the external walls because the addition of open air bricks can affect their condition.",1
0082_SO31.pdf,"Upon arrival Miss Hayles advised her main concern is the
ground floor bathroom to the rear of the property located
off the kitchen area.
The concerns relate to dampness in the structure that resulted in spoiling to a number of surfaces at low
level with it being advised repairs have previously been undertaken including a location to the hallway
wall adjoining the lounge at the base of the stairs.
The author was also advised of previous flooding incidents that resulted in localized flooding to the kitchen
and adjoining lounge. It was not possible to determine how the structure was successfully dried and if
respected drying goals had been achieved. However, there were no visible areas of concern to the author.
A review was undertaken of the structure through the areas both internally and externally to gauge any
likely clear issues that could align to the reported problems. Plus, an assessment of the current installed
extraction measures was compiled as this alone can relate to the reported mould.
Elevated readings were noted in some areas that could align with ongoing penetrations from the exterior
or a result of the previous flood. However, from a structural perspective, we were further advised cavity
wall insulation (CWI) had been installed and, such an undertaking can aid dampness penetration through
migration from the exterior to the interior. Elevated readings in the bathroom side wall coincided with
damaged render and algae growing to the exterior and is recommended the wall area is investigated to
check the cavity condition and that of the CWI.
From a ventilation perspective, the bathroom extractor is operating just below that recommended in Part
F of the Building regs however, with a defined overrun and constant operation, it is considered adequate
at this time and, the occupant has been advised of the impact an open window can have when it is working
in order to uphold its expected performance. However, this will require attention to the door whereby
the undercut is insufficient to uphold an effective operation.
The kitchen pull cord device delivers a flow below that recommended in the regs for this ‘wet’ room and
is recommended a review of this device is undertaken.
The occupant advised feeling cold and that the bathroom was delivering cold air through to the lounge. It
is the opinion of the author, the bathroom is not contributing to this issue and moreover, is due to a clear
and notable draught under the door to the garden. And, with the door to the lounge removed, will readily
cool the habitable room and compromise the anticipated living conditions.
In the hallway, a recent repair of the door architrave to the lounge was found to emit elevated moisture
readings to the adjoining riser skirt and the lower wall. With recent repairs undertaken and the indication
of a previous flooding incident, it is recommended this area is left until the summer period for it to be re-
assessed for any expected improvements in its condition prior to an invasive undertaking in order to
determine the likely root cause.
In conclusion, it is the opinion of the author the structure does indeed suggest localized areas of elevated
moisture however, in general they are borderline wet levels and could undergo a review after a period of
stabilization to determine if an ingress or other issue is occurring.
The exterior condition exhibited some areas of damage to the render, un-used passive vent plate and non-
observable DPC along the elevation which, alongside suggested CWI having been installed, can aid
moisture migration to the interior.",1
0138_E12.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant structural moisture levels affecting walls and
floors throughout the property. With regard to the internal plumbing (Section 6.1) the underfloor
heating system was holding pressure which would suggest it was free from leaks. It was reported leaks
to the internal waste water system had previously been identified. It is the opinion of the author based
on the moisture survey it is likely there are additional plumbing issues affecting the property.
A clear route for rainwater to affect the structure was identified in relation to the patio doors to the
front and rear of the property (Section 6.2). The internal floor structure was accessed in a controlled
manner (Section 6.3) and parts of the floor structure were shown to be wet at the survey location and is
the opinion of the author, this condition affects much of the floor area. Internal originating loss water
and external water ingress are thought to be affecting the floor structure. The invasive investigation into
the floor construction failed to identify a DPM and may well be the case the lower ground supported
floor slab is being affected by ground water as well as the noted loss water ingresses.
It was noted the plasterboard timber frame wall structures extend down to the base of the floor
construction and loss water is able to affect the wall structures throughout the property wetting the
framework plasterboard and thermal insulation.",0
0064_PO6.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture survey was undertaken throughout the property which did reveal some elevated
readings.
Elevated moisture readings were recorded consistently on floor surfaces which is likely to relate to the
floor tiles acting as part of the DPM to ground moisture. With regard to survey location points D & G it is
probable there is a leak from the flat directly above which will need further investigations. It is understood
the flat above is the same layout as the surveyed flat. As to the elevated surface readings noted at survey
location point L & M drilled readings were also recorded with the tenant being made aware of this and
the readings were at acceptable levels. This would indicate surface condensation is the issue, this was
confirmed with the thermal imagery survey (section 5.0)
21a Picton House Hussar Court Westside View Waterlooville Hants PO7 7SQ
In regard to how the flat is currently being ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in
both the kitchen and bathroom both of which were in a working order (section 6.0). The majority of the
windows have trickle vents with all noted to be in a poor condition. Three passive vents are noted in total
within both bedrooms with them either blocked up or closed.
Internal observations confirmed all the windows were suffering from condensation to such an extent
pooling water was noted on one of the window cils. The only evidence of mould contamination was
around some of the window reveals and on one of the pillows as pointed out by the tenant. Mould
development on contents can only be driven by elevated internal humidity levels and inadequate
ventilation which was the case at the time of the survey. The tenant confirmed surfaces had recently been
cleaned which may be attributed to the little evidence of mould.
In conclusion based upon observations made including a review of the thermal imagery pictures it is the
authors opinion the issues highlighted by the tenant is likely to be a combination of the following: -
 Inadequate ventilation during periods of elevated internal humidity levels
 Build up of colder areas forming behind contents.
 Regarding survey locations points D & E it is the author’s opinion there could be a leak from above.",3
0218_SE7.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure apart from raised levels indicated to the
bathroom floor mainly focused on the area adjacent to the bath and toilet and is not uncommon with
the indicated moisture being driven by occupational activity. Comments made by the owners indicated
the issues being experienced in the main appear to be driven by external temperatures being prevalent
during the winter months (Section 7.1.1). In addition to the issues affecting the window units and
reveals, staining was pointed out in relation to the decorative timber flooring through the property
(section 7.1.2). As indicated the areas affected were dry at the time of the survey and possible issues
relating to cleaning or possible condensation are the likely cause.
It is the opinion of the author condensation is the main driver for the issues being experienced through
the property and is being driven by occupational activities combined with ventilation issues. The survey
highlighted potential issues with the effectiveness of the extraction system to the bathroom whereby
the area will be a major source of atmospheric moisture in the property. In addition possible issues
associated with drying clothes in the property on a regular basis is advised (Section 7.2).",1
0249_TA6.pdf,"A moisture survey was carried out through the property (see section 5.0) and in general indicated elevated
readings close to the base of the wall structures only and, with a lack of adequate heating and air circulation, is
likely to be due to internal atmospheric conditions.
We are advised the tenant conducts washing and drying away from the property however, at the time of the
survey, the drying of clothes within the bedroom was noted (section 6.1). This activity will increase the internal
atmospheric conditions and, with high relative humidity and low air temperatures recorded, will lead to the
onset of damp conditions in the property as a whole. The calculated dew point temperatures for the internal
areas were noted to be close to the recorded air temperature and therefore, condensation to cold walls is
possible during the cooler nighttime periods.
The lack of forced ventilation within the property will also potentially lead to heightened internal atmospheric
conditions following use of the bathroom and any cooking undertaken in the kitchen. Mould noted to the
bathroom ceiling is indicative of a lack of ventilation after use.

0106_BN22.pdf,"A review of the floor slab moisture content was carried out through the surveyed areas namely the
ground floor bathroom and conservatory areas (Section 4.1). Non-invasive survey methods recorded
through the decorative floor coverings in general indicated a dry condition in relation to the
conservatory floor with raised levels indicated in the bathroom which is not uncommon considering the
nature of the area.
Issues were highlighted with the function of the extractor unit to the bathroom making this ineffective
(Section 6.1.1) and should be addressed.
Remote monitoring has been undertaken over a number of weeks (Section 5.0) and, based on criteria
detailed in BS 5250:2002 the moisture loads indicated in the conservatory compared to the external
conditions would in fact indicate a dry occupation in this area suggesting it is being ventilated to prevent
the build-up of high atmospheric moisture levels. In addition to gauging the internal atmosphere, the
remote monitoring also showed the specific humidity (g/Kg) at floor level in the area of concern behind
the wall unit was slightly less than the level recorded in the general conservatory area. This would
indicate moisture is not venting from the floor structure which was a concern of the tenant.
One of the main areas of mould activity concerning the tenant is seen to be growing on the UPVC wall
structure to the conservatory. UPVC being a plastic is effectively waterproof and as such will not allow
capillary moisture to migrate through it to sustain the noted mould activity. Therefore mould growing
on the UPVC must be sustained by atmospheric conditions and both the thermal survey (Section 4.3.1)
and the remote monitoring showed clearly a considerable temperature drop in this area due to the
location and nature of the wall construction. As air cools in the area of concern at the base of the wall
the relative humidity (%RH) increases as detailed in (Section 6.2) and, as the %RH increases
correspondingly the water increases allowing the moulds to flourish.
Based on the atmospheric moisture levels and recorded surface and air temperatures behind the wall
unit, it is the opinion of the author it is the temperatures which are providing the conditions sustaining
the mould. In fact taking the average recorded external specific humidity of 7.86 g/Kg and applying the
average wall temperature of 16.45°C, the resultant relative humidity would be 67.3%RH which is a level
sufficient to sustain mould activity.
It is understood underfloor heating is installed in the conservatory area but is currently not used by the
tenant due to concerns over its safety. It is the opinion of the author using the underfloor heating will
greatly improve the conditions under the wall unit plus, to the base of the wall. Heating the air in this
area will create a noticeable drop in the relative humidity and most likely reduce the levels to a point
where further mould activity is unlikely.",3
0259_TA6.pdf,"There are clearly some damp areas of the structure. These are related to moisture coming up
through the floor which has been overlaid with what I believe to be an early troweled damp proof
membrane comprising a clay product, probably similar to Bentonite, set within a carrier material
and binding agent. This appears to be breaking down as the surface is crazed and cracking as
shown in the attached photograph below. To the extent that that material is now also holding and
transferring moisture into the property.
The wettest area of the property is shown to the rear left hand side of the building as viewed
from the front and is located in the bedroom, adjacent to the party wall. The whole of the floor is
generally showing high moisture levels but as you move towards the front of the building and the
front right-hand side moisture levels start to drop down. It is therefore my opinion that something
has caused the increase in moisture level to the rear of the building. This could be related to
leaking sewers or water mains. I believe these are being inspected and repaired or cleared if
necessary.
There are high moisture levels in the walls to the rear of the property. The highest area being
where the floor has the highest moisture levels. I believe this is occurring because the DPC in the
wall at the rear is level or slightly below floor level therefore we are seeing a situation where
moisture is being transferred from below the DPC level via the floor into the wall above the
DPC.
Atmospheric readings internally also indicated that there is a source of moisture entering the
atmosphere internally.
I noted that there is no passive or electromechanical ventilation to the property. It was suggested
that the passive vent to the front of the lounge be opened. However, I do not feel that this would
result in the type of ventilation would be necessary to keep this building free of moisture.
Whilst there is no suggestion here that the problems in this building are caused by occupational
moisture I am of the opinion the internal atmosphere a humidity controlled extraction fan to the
bathroom and a manual controlled extraction fan to the kitchen to current building regulations.",1
0225_SO51.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant moisture levels across the gable end wall and
front elevation to the lounge and first floor bedroom. Invasive drilled readings (Section 4.3) indicated
the solid brick to be extensively affected by water ingress.
Possible issues were noted with regard to previous damp remediation works undertaken at the property
which may well be allowing ground water to affect the structure (Section 6.1). External observations
highlighted significant cracking to the external render which will allow rainwater to affect the structure
(Section 6.2). The moisture survey also highlighted possible issues with water ingress associated with the
chimney structure (Section 6.3).",0
0201_PO4.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the property (Section 4.0) and in general this
indicated dry structural moisture levels through the first floor (Section 4.1). However raised levels were
indicated in regard to the rear bedroom area (South west corner). With regard to the ground floor
(Section 4.2) significant moisture levels were indicated to many of the exterior and a number of interior
wall structures. However it was noted in general dry readings were recorded with regard to the timber
skirting’s. Drilled readings (Section 4.2.2) indicated a significant drop in moisture content deeper into
the wall structure.
A sample of the wall render was taken for off-site analysis from an area displaying high indicated
structural moisture levels. Gravimetric and salts analysis was carried out (Section 4.2.3) and this
indicated in relation to ‘free capillary moisture’, an acceptable level was indicated. However a significant
level of hygroscopic salts were present in the sample which would lead to elevated levels when
undertaking meter surveying on site (Section 6.5). It is the opinion of the author the presence of
hygroscopic salts is significant in relation to the indicated structural moisture levels indicated during the
survey. As well producing high moisture readings, hygroscopic salts will also cause damp patches to
appear in relation to affected wall areas during periods of high atmospheric moisture (% Relative
Humidity).
An invasive review of the cavity highlighted issues with the indicated injected cavity wall insulation
(Section 6.3) and possible bridging of the DPC with debris in the cavity. Inconsistent cavity wall insulation
can cause issues with internal wall temperatures which can produce raised resultant %RH levels
adjacent to the colder wall surfaces. In addition to internal wall temperatures, ineffective cavity
insulation can cause issues with interstitial condensation certainly in relation to south facing elevations.",1
0164_ME1.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) in general indicated a reasonably dry structure. However raised
moisture levels were indicated in a number of areas, namely the exterior wall to the lounge and
bedroom two, the internal wall structures associated with the now redundant fireplace and the party
wall to the entrance lobby adjacent to the bathroom in the adjoining property. With regard to the
exterior walls to the lounge and bedroom issues were highlighted (Sections 7.2 & 7.4) with regard to the
redundant chimney to the lounge. Issues with ventilation were also noted (Section 7.3).
Raised moisture levels were indicated to the floor structures through the property. However it is the
opinion of the author this is due to the suggested age of the property and the membrane detailing at the
time of construction. If however the property was constructed post 1965 it would be prudent to carry
out an invasive investigation to confirm the floor slab detailing.
The forced ventilation to the bathroom and kitchen was functioning. However issues were noted with
venting to the exterior etc. which will have an impact on their efficiency (Sections 6.2.1 & 6.2.2).
Cavity wall insulation has been installed at the property. The thermal survey (Section 5.0) highlighted
potential issues with the effectiveness of the installation which could drive interstitial condensation
within the cavity structure.",1
0149_GU3.pdf,"A moisture survey (Section 4.0) carried out through the ground floor indicated significant residual
moisture levels in the floor screed. The indicated loss affected area extended into the kitchen area and is
assumed to encompass the entrance lobby (Section 5.4). Invasive review of the floor structure did not
indicated standing loss water in the construction plus the floor insulation was dry at the survey locations
(Section 5.1).
Moisture barriers in the form of adhesive from the original timber flooring, tiled floor coverings and tile
adhesive not through the loss affected area (Section 5.3) the not barriers to evaporation will prevent
effective drying of the floor construction.
Based on the observations made it is the opinion of the author further tented focused drying the
affected areas of the floor is required, however it appears injection drying of the insulation layer is not
required. To allow the drying process to be effective enabling works will be required to remove the
barriers to evaporation, it is recommended the floor screed is ground. As well as maximizing evaporation
grinding the floor should provide a serviceable floor surface ready to receive the replacement decorative
flooring.
Drying process sign-off. A high spec engineered timber floor is to be installed through the majority of the
loss affected area this is to be glued directly to the floor screed. In situations where specialist floor
systems are to be installed, the drying process carried out should be certified using a method specified
by the flooring manufacturer and possible the adhesive manufacturer as well. As a minimum the
method specified in BS 8201:2011 Code of practice for installation of flooring of wood and wooden
panels, should be applied. It is the opinion of the author a verity of methods should be used to allow
cross reference which will produce a robust certification process.
When certifying the moisture content in the floor screed the fact the floor is heated should be taken
into account. As many floor manufacturers required differing moisture levels in heated and un-heated
floor slabs.",0
0090_TA9.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section
4.0) highlighting there are significant areas of damp in
both the floor (Section 4.1), base of the walls and skirting
(Section 4.2).It is the opinion of the author, the source of
damp appears to be the bathroom, possibly from the
shower cubicle. In 1965 it became a requirement with the
1st edition of the building regulations for DPM’s to be
installed and, it is probably a bitumen applied dpm
(evidenced by the visible bitumen damp proof course).
Water escaping from the bathroom can sit between the
DPM and the vinyl floor covering.
It is the opinion of the author, the source of damp allowing the mould in the property to proliferate is
atmospheric. In general, this is driven by the inadequate extraction and occupational activity.Issues
were highlighted with the installed extractor fans which need to be addressed (Section 6.2) and the fact
the extractor fan fitted in the bathroom is not working correctly. Observations would also suggest there
is an issue with the provision regarding meeting the ‘Whole dwelling ventilation rate’ as detailed in part
F of the building regs (Section 6.6).
It is the opinion of the author, the source of damp affecting the section of kitchen wall that is not drying
out after replastering (location A), may be due to the blocked-up window whereby the
blockwork/window could be bridging the cavity and allowing the interstitial condensation to fall onto
the internal leaf of the wall and/or the damp from the bathroom could be climbing the wall via capillary
action.",1
0049_ME2.pdf,"We understand 1 adult and 1 child reside at the address alongside a large dog which would correlate to
another adult in terms of atmospheric moisture generation.
A detailed moisture survey undertaken (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry structure with particular
attention to the areas of concern being window reveals. External walls were dry however, those in
bedroom 1 could not be assessed as the room was being re-painted on arrival. In the lounge it was
noted the walls appear dry lined and, no decision can be given with regard to any potential mould issues
behind them.
An elevated reading was noted to the floor immediately close to the bath and, upon pulling back the
floor covering, dampness was clearly evident and is recommended the plumbing/sealant is checked for
any contributory factors since the floors in all other areas did not indicate any elevated readings.
An external assessment of the building fabric noted a number of bricks having previously been removed
and, a visual and manual inspection of the respective cavities confirmed no evidence of cavity wall
insulation and the DPC being in good order around the property.
With a dry structure, an assessment of installed ventilation measures was conducted since a lack of
adequate extraction in ‘wet’ rooms (kitchens and bathrooms) can readily lead to moisture laden air
travelling through the property aided by differences in vapour pressure when doors are opened.
This in turn, can lead to moisture laden air residing behind contents and coming into contact with colder
surfaces i.e. windows and walls, leading to periods of condensation and resultant mould.
It was noted, a continuous running fan in the bathroom alongside an intermittent unit in the kitchen
does not comply with similar devices being installed as recommended in Part F of the Building Regs.
On test, the current extraction devices appeared to be impaired by their cleanliness which can reduce
their operating potential and, was the same observation with all passive trickle vents throughout the
property.
The bathroom constant running unit recorded a 3.8 l/s flow rate with a pull-cord for two boost speed
levels delivering 6.5 l/s and 9.9 l/s respectively. In full boost mode the recommended continuous flow
rate is 8.0 l/s (Part F Building Regs 2010 and 2020) which in this case, would only be met when manually
placed in this mode by the resident for effective constant extraction of this room.
The kitchen device was isolated on arrival and is an intermittent single flow unit which on test delivered
a recorded flow rate of 14.6 l/s. The Part F recommended flow rate for a kitchen intermittent unit away
from the cooker is 60 l/s and is therefore deemed insufficient for a kitchen extraction device.
To the exterior the vent outlet points appear to be air bricks and, there is no clear evidence the ducting
meets the bricks for a sufficient extraction to the exterior and not into the cavity.
Additional support measures include the internal door undercuts which were adequate in compliance
with the recommended 10mm gap between the door underside and floor finish as per Part F of the
Building Regs. However, both the kitchen door and nearby lounge door were not able to be opened and
closed easily hence, is likely these doors are not shut after use (particularly the kitchen door) resulting in
excess vapour able to circulate the property leading to potential mould issues.
Based upon the information gathered herein, it is the opinion of the author the structural moisture
readings were at acceptable levels and not contributing to the reported mould on the building fabric and
contents items. The source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate will likely be
atmospheric related which in general, is driven by occupational activity alongside a lack of adequate
ventilation. In support of this opinion, there is a mix of devices in the wet rooms which does not comply
and trickle vents in wet rooms should be closed to maximise extraction performance. It may be possible
to adjust the bathroom unit by a respective trade expert however, a consideration for the kitchen is to
replace the device with a dMEV type. Ducting to the exterior requires confirming it is connected to the
external air brick and not expelling into the cavity.
Separately, there may be a water related issue within the bathroom as indicated herein that will not
contribute to the reported mould related issues.
With a below-street level property not readily benefitting from any warmth from the sun, it is
understood the occupants will likely heat the dwelling more than an average family home. This ‘normal’
activity can be borne out of a perceived cold environment and, with this in mind, will place a greater
emphasis on adequate ventilation measures being installed with minimal manual interaction. Of note,
the atmospheric conditions recorded at the time (section 4.4) indicated a ‘moist’ occupancy in line with
the relevant BS standard for the Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: Annex B
Moisture generation and ventilation in occupied buildings indicating the internal atmosphere at this time
had a higher vapour pressure than the exterior possibly due to closed windows prior to the survey.
In support of the current conditions and those experienced by the residents particularly during the
colder periods of the year, relevant guidance can be given aligned to closing doors, furniture
placements, opening trickle vents in habitable rooms and clearing ‘normal’ condensation on windows
every morning. Having been advised the drying of clothes internally is undertaken, this too can be
regarded as a ‘normal’ phenomenon but, requires air changes to expel the generated internal
atmospheric moisture and reduce the potential for mould to stabilize and develop. Our
recommendations below will aid these everyday activities.",3
0060_PO15.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the areas of concern which revealed a dry structure.
In regard to ventilation measures, there are passive trickle vents to the windows all of which were noted to be open
at the time of the survey. In addition, there are mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen with the
latter currently being restricted by the broken window blind. This particular issue the tenant is aware of.
Observations clearly revealed condensation was occurring on the first floor and there was some evidence of mould.
In conclusion the concerns of the tenant are, in the opinion of the author, attributed to periods of elevated internal
humidity levels, inadequate ventilation and colder areas able to develop at the base of wall surfaces behind contents.
This conclusion is supported by the evidence gathered in the thermal imaging section.

0111_BS27.pdf,"I carried out a thorough investigation throughout the property taking REL and WME damp meter
readings which are shown in the tables below together with atmospheric readings internally and
externally to look at the environmental conditions existing within the building. I inspected the
cavity wall on the gable as well as the chimney flue and the chimney stack taking relative and
specific humidity readings as well as temperature readings within the cavity flue and solid
brickwork. I took an in-depth WME reading 125 mm into the chimney stack brickwork.
At the time of survey External relative humidity was in the region of 57% air temperature of
18.1°C Dew Point 9.5°C and specific humidity 7.4 g/kg of air. The internal readings for specific
humidity averaged out at 8.78 g/kg which is only marginally higher than the external 7.4g/kg.
However one exception to this was Bedroom 1 which had readings of 10.2 the 1st time and 10.3
when I carried out a subsequent check. I could find no reason for this high SH reading within the
room itself, but the design of the building could be such that there is moisture vapour movement
from a damp part of the structure. Notwithstanding I do not feel that this is a significant issue
that warrants any further investigation.
Damp meter readings taken internally showed that all sections of the structure connected to the
chimney breast on the gable wall of the building had extremely high REL moisture readings
which indicate that there is moisture at depths within the inner skin of the wall. WME readings
were also very high in places and certainly considerably higher than I would expect in a property
that is habitable and well above the lower limit of 18% where damage will occur to any organic
materials.
Drillings into the chimney breast and cavity wall revealed extremely high WME readings of 40%
125 mm into the solid brickwork.
I am in no doubt that the condition of the rendering to the gable wall is the main cause for the
damp ingress into the wall. There also appears to be an anomaly with the construction of the
chimney in that as far as I can tell the cavity wall does not continue past the chimney stack where
the construction reverts to solid brick with a flue through the centre. The walls of the property
have been cavity filled with insulation which makes the chimney stack a cold bridge in the
insulated gable walls. This will give rise to surface condensation; interstitial condensation within
the brickwork and where the rendering is poor allow moisture to transfer through the solid brick
into the property. Hence the cold wet strip in the living room wall. See Pictures 7.3 below.
I have not carried out invasive investigations into the wall adjacent to the wet strip across the
chimney breast in the living room. However, all the evidence points to the possibility of a lintel
cast into the wall within the chimney flue or support slab cast right through the flue in one
section. Notwithstanding the construction methods and detailing used, the only practical solution
to solving this problem is to stop damp ingress into the wall externally by removing the render
and re-rendering, but simple rendering will leave the problem of the cold bridge on both ground
and first floor.
Please note that this building is ""Rough Cast Rendered"" This is traditionally Lime Based and
should not be replaced with a sand and cement render under any circumstances as this will
be detrimental to the structure.
I recommend that consideration be given to removing the rendering during the summer months,
leaving it covered/protected from weather with good air flow over it for at least 4 months and
then insulating externally with a vapour permeable/breathable insulation system and rendering
with a self coloured thin coat silicate render (K Rend or similar). This would remove the cold
bridge. Particular attention should be paid to the top edge with the roof verge and the detailing on
the steps in the chimney flue and around the windows, so that there are no vulnerable points of
water entry.
Internally drying out of the wall will be sped up with the aid of dehumidifiers, but drying would
be pointless until the external rendering has been hacked of and drying out is underway
externally otherwise moisture will just be drawn through from outside. It should be anticipated
that the walls will have salt deposit in the form of efflorescence occurring to a greater degree as
the drying process is sped up. This will therefore mean that internal decorations might be
damaged but this can be assessed at the end of the drying process. The drying process will be
greatly improved internally by removing the rendering and plaster to allow faster evaporation
from the core of the structure.
I noted that there were high damp readings to the painted brick/block walls in the dining area. I
believe that this might be related to moisture from cooking condensing in this area as there is no
door sealing it off from the kitchen and the kitchen has not extraction system. Ideally this should
be addressed.
I noted high moisture readings in the dividing wall between bedroom 2 and the bathroom. These
might be ""False Positives"". I recommend that these be re-visited if after the rendering works are
address, there is still a problem in this area.",1
0044_LU4.pdf,"It was advised the tenants have resided within the property since October 2016 and issues within the
kitchen occurred within a month of moving in. Mould was also reported to the external walls and areas
of the ceiling, further developing in other rooms over time.
A moisture profile of the affected area gave elevated readings within a number of locations and a
thermal imaging survey indicated cold spots to varying areas.
Within the lounge at the base of the external wall (Survey location point A) decorative damage was
observed with elevated moisture readings. Drilled readings were recorded at this point with levels of
moisture reducing further into the structure which would indicate an issue with condensation as the
likely cause.
Mould was noted within the kitchen to areas of the ceiling and external walls along with flaking paint. At
the time of the survey condensation was noted to the UPVC windows and tiled surfaces in this area
which the surveyor believes to be due to incorrect use of heating and extraction units. At the time of the
survey the extraction unit was not in use while the tenant was cooking and instead, the back door was
left open.
Water droplets were noted to areas of the ceiling above the back door as well as within the bathroom to
the rear of the property and flaking paint was also noted to areas of the external walls. An external
observation was undertaken which revealed a sloping roof with no defects visualised. Thermal imagery
of this area (section 5.6) suggests insulation could be insufficient and should be a consideration for
inspection.
Within the bathroom a piece of plastic is rolled up covering a section of the seal around the bath which
is in a poor state.
There were no reported issues regarding the central heating system however it was noted that some of
the radiators were completely obstructed by furniture.
A single wash load is reportedly processed a week with the majority of the items advised as being dried
away from the property however when drying is undertaken within the property, bedroom 1 is used.
A 100mm extraction unit was evident within the bathroom which operates via a pull cord with no
overrun after use. The unit has a flow rate of 1.1 MS which equates to 11.4 minutes to complete one
complete air change. The surveyor also recommends that this unit is cleaned to ensure optimum
performance. A 100mm extraction unit was also noted within the kitchen which has a two-speed setting
and operates via an isolator switch only.
The windows have trickle vents fitted however none of these were open at the time of the survey.
External observations revealed a number of air bricks have been covered and the DPC to the rear of the
property is being bridged by shingle. The UPVC window within the bathroom was seen to be poorly
fitted with noticeable gaps down the side of the frame which has potential to allow moisture into the
structure.
It is the opinion of the author that the main cause of the mould and condensation is primarily caused by
internal atmospheric conditions and a lack of adequate heating/ventilation throughout the property.
When using the bathroom and kitchen, the fitted extraction units should be used at all times with
consideration given to an overrun to expel the moist air after use as indicated herein.
It is recommended attention should also be given to a new seal around the bath and the window.
Contents should be moved from radiators and external walls to allow for sufficient heating and natural
air flow.
Air bricks to the exterior should be free of any obstruction to allow for ventilation of the subfloor and
consideration should be given to removing the bridging to the DPC.",3
0258_TA6.pdf,"On arrival property all windows were open throughout. There was no apparent evidence of any
surface damp being present at the time of surveying and no mould spots apart from a few in the
kitchen. There were high REL readings in the rear wall at mid first floor level and ground floor
to the rear of the building and on the front corner wall where it could be seen that cavity wall was
insulation was obviously present by the holes from injection. Water has been leaking from the
Finlock Gutters down most of the rear wall and the front right hand corner by the downpipe.
The whole of the ground floor was sealed over with laminate or slate flooring. I was therefore
unable to ascertain if any moisture was coming from below the floor, but there were no contra
indications to this in any of my low level readings
I was satisfied that the main source of moisture ingress into this structure was the rear wall from
the leaking gutters via the wet CWI. Whilst the floor could potentially be a source of moisture
there where no contra indications to show this.
It is my opinion that the problems of mould growth on the internal walls of this property at first
floor level are being caused by cold bridging at the top of first floor walls due to
settlement/slumping of the insulation within the cavity leaving a margin of wall that is
uninsulated. Coupled with this water is leaking into the cavity wall and bridging the cavity and
the CWI is holding moisture.
There will be a significant increase in thermal conductivity when insulation gets wet and
internally the surface temperature of the wall will drop below dew point for the relative humidity
(RH) in the room. Increases in heat internally to combat this drop increases evaporation and the
RH then rises as it evaporates moisture from the damp areas of wall to reach equilibrium. The net
effect is a raising of the dew point temperature at which vapour condenses to moisture droplets
onto cold areas of the structure. The design of the property has concrete lintels at the head of
windows and these are cold bridges to the insulated structure where condensation is most likely
to occur.
I am advised that this property was being considered for a PPU (Positive Pressure Unit). I am in
no doubt that if such a unit had of been fitted it would have made matters worse by effectively
turning the unventilated loft into a ""battery"" to store moisture that then gets released back into
the building when the right conditions arise. i.e. when the vapour pressure is lower in the
habitable rooms than the loft area.
The primary driver for moisture into this structure is the defective Finlock Gutters. Removing or
repairing the Finlock Guttering will significantly improve the problem of moisture control in this
property.
It will not be possible to fully clear up the cold bridging at the concrete lintols without making
significant changes to the construction of the lintels and window heads. It must therefore be
expected that additional controls of moisture will be needed to be put in place to ensure that the
Relative Humidity inside the building does not rise to unacceptable levels as a result of any
source of moisture. I therefore recommend that mechanical/electrical fans are installed in the
kitchen and bathroom and ideally these are operated by a humidistat that takes away manual
operation from the tenants.
I noted that there was some settlement cracking to the front of the property and that this was
most noticeable on the RHS as viewed from the front. There is also a possible point of entry for
moisture at the junction of the concrete porch roofs on the front elevation. These should both be
investigated further.",1
0098_BN11.pdf,"The main area of mould is affecting the window reveal in the master bedroom however it was noted in
small traces in other areas, the tenants are reporting have to cleaned the affected areas to the window
reveals on a regular basis although this was not observed at the time of survey.
There are three persons residing at the property and approximately 25 pet tanks and a large rabbit
hutch also kept within the flat. Approximately two washing loads are undertaken per week although
there was no indication of where the items were subsequently dried.
Fenestration had trickle vents open at the time of survey however some condensation on windows may
indicate that these are closed at night.
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure however issues were noted with the control
of the forced ventilation to the bathroom (Section 6.1) and the kitchen (Section 6.2).
Both the bathroom extractor and the kitchen extractor were switched off at the isolator switch at the
time of the survey and the kitchen unit was not functioning at the time.
Based on the observations during the survey it is the opinion of the author the main driver for the
reported mould activity and condensation is raised atmospheric moisture levels likely generated through
occupational activity and reduced and ineffective ventilation.",3
0248_TA6.pdf,"There were no areas of damp or water ingress detected in the property at all including the gable wall of
the property. Neither were there any areas of rising damp or structural defects that might give rise to
water ingress. On the contrary, I found the building to be dry save for the small areas of mould where it
was my view that the raised moisture levels were as a result of condensation. These are recorded below
at 6.4 Structural Readings.
Whilst the occupants do appear to have an admitted they have a cluttered building, they advised me
that this is a temporary state due to their daughter moving in with them recently and having to
accommodate her belongings. They are aware of the fact that they have to de-clutter. Notwithstanding,
I do not concur with any of the findings of the previous surveys that blame the damp and condensation
issues on their cluttered building and lifestyle.
It is my opinion that the actual causes of mould stem from condensation that results from three or four
factors that combine to affect the atmospheric conditions within the property. These are:
 I am advised that a new extraction fan was recently fitted. This might have been a consideration
if the previous fan was performing below requirements for this property or was not working.
However, the current fan is also defective and only extracting at approximately 6.3 litres/sec.
This is only 42% of that required under current building regulations which require a MINIMUM
of 15 litres/sec. The bathroom extraction therefore needs addressing.
 Thermographic imaging shows that there is a continuous cold bridge around the building at the
junction between the head of the external walls and the ceilings. This is a typical fault in many
early timber framed designs and the coldest areas are often the edge of the ceiling where the
loft insulation is not in contact with both the plasterboard and the top of the wall plate. In this
instance the very shallow pitch of the roof has probably made it difficult to fit the insulation in
the area, however better care could be taken to ensure that this vulnerable area is insulated
properly. See picture 7.1 below.
 The property does not have any form of electro/mechanical ventilation to the kitchen. In my
view with modern draught proof glazing and doors this is a necessity. The tenants are aware
that they need to keep the kitchen well ventilated and advised that they do keep the door open
as much as possible, however this is not always a realistic prospect in very cold, wet or windy
weather and can therefore be impractical.
 Early timber frame properties often used vapour impermeable membranes to wrap the timber
frame prior to cladding with brick. These even extended to using polythene. This property might
therefore have walls that are not vapour permeable, therefore even though they are insulated,
at times when there is no extraction running or windows and doors open i.e. night time, it is
possible that the only parts of the structure that can absorb vapour will be the through the
ceiling, as the floors, though beam and block, have been largely tiled over or covered with vinyl.
Thankfully the roof void is well ventilated with continuous soffit vents around the structure and a
ventilated ridge system. The introduction of a Positive Pressure Unit (PPU) into this structure was in my
view unnecessary since the main cause of moisture is occupational and whilst the loft is well ventilated it
can still give rise at times to re-circulation of moist air.
The solution to controlling moisture in this building would in my view be best served by a MVHR (whole
house heat ventilation system with a heat recovery unit) since it is small and compact and could be
easily installed. The loft space would need to be cleared to install this, but the tenants did advise that
they were conscious that this needed to be cleared.
The PPU unit could be recovered and used elsewhere since it is impractical in this property.",3
0065_PO7.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the property which in most locations gave dry readings. In the kitchen at survey point
D elevated readings were recorded suggesting an internal leak and, Mrs Taylor confirmed there was a minor leak under the sink.
In the lounge and one of the areas of concern is at survey point E with elevated readings and minor staining on the ceiling noted and, directly
above is the Juliet balcony for the flat above which may be the driving factor.
In regard to ventilation measures there is a working mechanical extraction unit in the bathroom, a PIV unit bringing in fresh air into the hallway
and all windows have trickle vents which were all open.
At the time of survey there was no visible evidence of mould however, the author was shown photographs of affected furniture. Plus, there were
no visible signs of condensation the thermal images clearly show condensation is an issue.
In conclusion based upon the recorded moisture readings and observations made including those in the thermal image section, it is the author’s
opinion the concerns of Mrs Taylor mainly relate to periods of raised internal humidity levels and a general lack of ventilation. This is supported
by an underperforming extraction unit in the bathroom, no extraction unit in the kitchen and colder areas forming behind contents.

Scope
Following instruction from GDS, re-attend the above properties to report on current moisture conditions
and investigate reported damp issues.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is an upper dwelling in a purpose built block
concrete frame construction, with a mix of brick and
precast pebble dashed concrete panels forming the outer
skin of what is assumed to be cavity a construction
external wall structures.
2.0 Incident:
Water ingress is reported to be affecting the window
reveal to the kitchen in the loss address. This is located
under the open balcony to the top floor flat above.
Replacement UPVC window units have been installed throughout the block, it is reported previous
works have been carried in an effort to alleviate the issues.
3.0 Conclusion – First visit - 21st October:
A review of the internal surfaces in general identified moderate moisture levels (Section 4.0) which
would tend to suggest the water ingress is not significant, this may well be due to the fact the affected
window is east facing (Section 5.2). Three areas of possible water were noted to the exterior it is
recommended water testing is carried in these three areas in the order they area detailed. The loss
affected area sits under the open balcony the top floor flat above. Access to the balcony was not
possible at the time of the survey. However it is the opinion of the author dew to the nature of the
reported water ingress it is more likely it is water penetration through the exterior wall structure.
3.1 Water testing – Second visit – 16th November:
Attended the site with Mitie’s site manager to carry out water testing, the areas of concern previously
noted (Section 5.3) had been addressed. Mitie’s site manager went inside the property with a moisture
meet to monitor and video the test. The author carried out the water test to the exterior, using a hose
and sprinkler to replicate heavy rain water was applied to the previously highlighted areas in a
methodical manner. In addition to the highlighted areas the adjoining wall structures, planter to the
balcony above and the balcony above the loss affected kitchen to flat 33 were thoroughly tested. The
duration of the test was approximately 1.5 hours. Moisture readings in the skim plaster to the reveal
were monitored by Mitie’s manager before during and at the conclusion to the test no decernablr water
ingress was noted.
19th November 10:15 Mitie’s site manager Warren Ellis was contacted today, it was confirmed as yet
there had not been any contact from the tenant to indicate any further water ingress.

5.0 Observations and relevant information:
5.1 Wall decoration:
Pictured is the reported main area of water ingress, it was
confirmed this area had been redecorated in April 2015
approximately 6 months prior to the site visit. There areas
to be little if no water staining in the reported loss
affected area.
5.2 Orientation of the structure:
The loss affected window faces due east as such it in general will not be affected by the prevailing
weather as it is located on the leeward side of the structure. This may well be a reason the reported
water ingress does not appear to be significant.
5.3 External review:
A review of the exterior adjacent to and above the reported main area of water ingress highlighted
three areas where rain water could possible enter the structure:
5.3.1 Drip formed in external precast panel:
It was noted the drip to the underside of the pre-cast
panel above the affected window is compromised by an
issue in the panel. This will allow rain water running down
the face of the panel to migrate back at the base of the
panel to the window seal and possible in to the structure
across the top of the window.
5.3.2 Mortar fillet to top of pre-cast panel:
The top of the panel is sealed with a mortar fillet the area
of the fillet directly above the suggested area of water
ingress is cracked and de-bonded.
5.3.3 Planter to balcony area:
An open balcony to the flat above is located above the
loss affected area. A planter is formed in the top of the
parapet wall. The pictured plan is growing out of a crack
in the concrete structure just above and to the right of
the area to the cement fillet detailed in ‘5.3.2’.
6.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on none wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.

0200_PO4.pdf,"A cold damp point at the bottom corner of the wall in the dining room is likely to be consistent with the
property’s floor dating pre 1965.
It was noted that at the time of the survey with the heating on, the surface temperature at the roof
skilling was about 3°C higher than the recorded Dew Point Temperature. It is therefore a consideration
that at night with a natural drop in temperature, condensation may be occurring in this area.
Cavity wall insulation and 250mm of mineral fiber is noted in the loft but is likely the sloping ceiling area
lacks adequate insulation and is therefore prone to condensation forming as it is a heat loss perimeter.
To deal with the skillings, options include the dropping of the area and reinstating with insulation or
creating a new skilling ceiling on top of the existing area with insulation incorporated in the additional
construction to reduce the temperature differential in these cold locations.",1
0160_LU1.pdf,"It was noted that there was a significantly wet patch above the kitchen window at the side of
the water pipe. The exterior directly opposite this also is extremely wet which would indicate a
possible leak within this area. However without further investigation an exact prognosis would
not be possible.
It was also noted that a slow drip of water was emanating from this area and pooling on the
window sill. It is the opinion of the author that due to this water ingress and very high
temperature within the property causing evaporation. Due to the lack of ventilation is
condensing on the exterior walls and windows thus resulting in optimum conditions for mould
growth.
It was noted that there is no expel air units within the property and the property appears
constantly sealed. Consequently there is nowhere for the moisture laden air to disperse.",1
0110_BS26.pdf,"The reported mould was evident to the walls in the lounge, kitchen and bathroom, but was also evident
in the scullery, dining room and bedroom 1. As mould has been present throughout the property, it will
reoccur if not remediated effectively with a fungicidal treatment to eradicate the root system prior to
any redecoration.
The moisture survey (Section 4.2) indicated in general the wall structures to the first floor presented dry
readings, including walls and ceilings displaying mould. It is considered the upper floor of the property is
benefiting from a positive pressure warm air unit fitted in the ceiling of the landing, though as the
tenants appear to keep the ground floor rooms they use closed to the remainder of the house, these do
not benefit from the advantages the system offers. Accordingly, analysis of the occupancy atmospherics
(Section 4.6) has separated the upstairs rooms from those used downstairs, indicating the ground floor
occupancy driven humidity’s are borderline ‘moist’.
Though the places displaying mould on the ground floor were also presenting dry readings, the survey
indicated areas requiring further analysis. It was noted the tenant has removed the skirting in the living
room claiming them to be rotten (Section 6.1). The recording of high readings to the skirting where
fitted on the ground floor suggests a possible issue with the floor screed to internal wall junction. An
invasive inspection should be considered to confirm if this is the possible cause for the high moisture
readings across the ground floor at low level in this property.
In the dining room mould is noted at high level to the southeast facing window wall (Section 6.2) and
beneath the pealing wallpaper, though this was largely measured as dry. Discussions with the tenant
revealed a previous problem with guttering to the corresponding external walls at locations Q and R
(Section 6.3) caused moisture ingress in these locations and may also have contributed to high readings
in the hall. These are claimed to have reduced since being repaired.
On the southwest wall at the site corresponding with an external chimney breast where an old fireplace
is now covered and the hearth removed, there are high readings at low level and at mid-height upwards.
Low level invasive drilled readings recorded at depth into the wall structure at location Y support the
readings taken (Section 4.4), whilst visible damp patches were evident to the wall. The chimney stack
has been removed to below the roof line and a high level passive vent installed (Section 6.4). An
examination of the loft space (Section 6.5) reveals the passive vent does not solely vent the stack but
also the loft space. Further, it could not be determined from a distance if the stack has been capped,
therefore an inspection should be considered since capping would reduce air flow through the stack; the
inspection would also provide an opportunity to confirm or otherwise a clear path through the stack.
Pulling back the carpet in this area of the living room reveals the outline of the previous hearth (Section
6.6), which has not had thermoplastic tiles installed upon it. It is visibly wet, staining the carpet and floor
readings taken support this (Section 4.3). This suggests an issue with the floor screed to chimney stack
wall junction. An invasive inspection should be considered to confirm if this is the likely cause for the
wetness and high moisture readings in this area.
On both the internal and external stack walls there are passive vents, though the internal usually has a
lounge suite along the wall and the external has shed or fencing panels stacked against it (Section 6.7).
Where possible, the vents should have a clear path for beneficial air movement.
A concern raised by the tenant was a mould patch extending from the wall onto the ceiling above the
window (location W), though this measured dry at the time of the survey (Section 4.3). A review of the
loft through the tiles above this location revealed the membrane under the tiles is sagging from the
weight of accumulated debris and is torn in places (Section 6.8). The tenant commented on plans for
the roof being replaced.
The extractor fan in the bathroom is claimed to be humidistat controlled, however it is not drawing air
from the room at regulation recommended rates (Section 5.3). There is extensive mould to the ceiling
(Section 6.9) and a visual inspection of this corresponding structure in the loft revealed areas of uneven
and uninsulated spaces (Section 6.10). This may be contributing to the opportunity and patterning for
mould to form.",3
0029_L19.pdf,"Upon entering the property, it was obvious the flat was suffering from extensive mould contamination, with the
tenant reporting this has been occurring since he moved in in 2019. Plus, it was advised the issues became more
severe when the heating was turned off in May last year for a period of approximately 6 months.
During the survey observations revealed all walls at low level have severe damp issues and in addition, the lounge
has severe damp and mould at high-level to the front elevation.
The lounge has laminate flooring over a herring bone wood floor which is laid on a bitumen mastic base recessed
into the floor with a concrete surrounding border.
Prior to arrival the laminate had been uplifted due to it going into failure.
An inspection of the sub-floor confirmed the wood floor to be extremely wet with the dirt between the concrete
border and wood floor being saturated indicating ground moisture coming up.
Continuing the survey in the bathroom which comprises of a shower, sink, and toilet with no forced air extraction
currently installed. The walls are in a poor condition with severe damp at low level and surface paint blistering in
sporadic areas likely caused by high atmospheric conditions due to inadequate ventilation.
It was observed that the communal hallway adjacent to the flat is also presenting damp issues at low level.
Samples from the walls in the flat and communal hallway have been collected for independent analysis to
aid determining the likely moisture source.
External observations revealed the top front elevation directly opposite the wet areas in the lounge has no DPC and
the old injected DPC is within the brick and not the mortar with it stopping at the front door.
Plus, mortar joints to the brickwork are in a poor condition with mortar missing directly opposite the wet area of the
lounge that may well be allowing driving rain to penetrate the brickwork.
In addition, guttering above the lounge is blocked allowing rainwater to cascade over the guttering and pass
through the structure which is likely causing damage within the lounge at high-level.
In conclusion it is the opinion of the author the property has a rising damp issue and water is penetrating the
structure due to inadequate mortar joints and guttering. It is recommended the structure is assessed by respective
expert trades for rectification of the noted poor elements and also a damp remediation company is sought to review
the integrity of the injected DPC with a view to determining if indeed it is effective and if not, a proposal for suitable
remediation.
Update 23/04/2024 – Gravimetric results for samples taken…
Samples from the walls in the flat and communal hallway were collected with sample 1 being the lounge and
sample 2 being from the hallway:
Moisture Content:
Sample Total Moisture Content Hygroscopic (air dry) Moisture Free Moisture Content
(%) Content (%) (%)
1 28.8 0.9 27.9
2 2.9 2.8 0.1
this indicates that the environment within the wall at the time the samples were removed was less humid than the
conditions used for the analysis. Such results also indicate that the material was ‘dry’ (no free moisture), ie, no
water ingress, and the results have been recorded as 'nil'.
Soluble Salts:
Sample Chloride # Nitrate #
1 ns ns
2 ** ****
# - can be hygroscopic Salts key: ns – not significant *- Trace
**- Low ***- Moderate
****- Heavy *****- Very heavy
Conclusion: The sample from the lounge contained significant free moisture and is indicative of either an ingress,
leak or discharge etc. such that, a detailed assessment is recommended to resolve the issue prior to drying the
structure.
Sample 2 in the hall did not contain any free moisture with the likely high moisture meter reading aligning to the
heavy level of salts which can affect the electronic meter. High nitrate levels can be associated with rising damp
and may require further investigation including below floor level for a detailed conclusion.

Lounge opposite the area of wall with the poor mortar joints. The colder
aspect of the image aligns to areas of raised moisture readings and is
recommended the mortar is inspected and remediated where needed.",2
0084_SO50.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the property which in the main revealed a
dry structure other than to the floor in the kitchen which coverings are likely to be acting as part of a
DPM to ground moisture due to the age of the property.
The dwelling is currently being ventilated by mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and
kitchen. A passive vent in the second bedroom has been taped over and, there are trickle vents to the
windows, most of which were closed.
At the time of the survey mould was an issue to most of the uPVC window frames and on wall surfaces
within the bathroom along with evidence of condensation to the window in bedroom 2. In addition
clothing being dried in various locations which can add to the internal atmospheric moisture load.
In conclusion based upon dry structural readings, observations made and reviewing the thermal images
(section 5.0), issues highlighted by the tenant are likely to be attributed to inadequate ventilation that is
exacerbated by the ongoing moisture generation in the property.",3
0211_RM17.pdf,"The structural moisture survey (Section 4.1) carried out in the areas of concern in general indicated a dry
structure. However raised moisture levels were indicated with regard to the bathroom and in particular
the bath area (Section 6.3). With regard to the forced ventilation of the property (Section 6.1) the author
has serious concerns with regard to its effectiveness. It appears the cooker hood to the Kitchen area is in
fact a filter unit and the route of discharge of the bathroom extractor is questioned. If the unit does
discharge to the exterior it is likely the route does not fall within the manufacturers design
recommendations. Due to the design of the property it is essential effective damp area extraction is
achieved in the bathroom and kitchen areas.
Based on the observations made it is the opinion of the author the areas of persistent mould reported
are being primarily driven by atmospheric moisture levels.
The passive ventilation of the property is via the two bedroom windows and the patio doors to the
lounge area with all of these being north facing. Certainly in the case of the patio doors to the lounge,
heat retention and effective ventilation is going to be very difficult to achieve. With all the ventilation on
one elevation, cross ventilation is not possible and in addition to it being the North facing elevation, the
property will not benefit from the prevailing winds for the majority of the year.",3
0238_SW18.pdf,"Structural moisture readings in the loss affected areas indicated a dry structure at the time of the survey

It was reported contents adjacent to the window areas have been affected by mould. Mould affecting
contents will be supported by atmospheric moisture levels only.
It is the opinion of the author the issues being experienced at the property are being driven by internal
atmospheric conditions and these will obviously have a greater effect during periods of colder weather.",0

Scope
Following instruction from ………………, attend the above property to carry out a survey to establish the
cause for mould principally in one of the bedrooms but also present elsewhere.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a two storey 3-bedroom maisonette in a
block of similar units constructed in the 1950’s. The
construction is brick and block cavity and compartment
walling with composite glazed and panelled walling set
into a reinforced concrete frame. The structure has solid
concrete floors overlaid with timber planking internally,
presumably on battens and paving grade asphalt to all
external walkways. The maisonette is situated on the first
and second floors and is in the third bay from the gable
end shown. The entrance is on the first floor above the
garage level.
2.0 Incident and observations:
Mr and Mrs Palmer have lived in the property for
approximately 4 years and recently reported a problem
with heavy mould growth in the property (dates
unconfirmed). Mr Palmer advised the main problem area
has been in the largest bedroom 1 which is situated on
the North West facing elevation where there is a walkway
outside for maintenance access. He added that at times
the outside wall is so wet with condensation that they
have to dry it off with towels.
Access was only granted to assess the bedroom and bathroom and this in itself was limited by the
furniture and fittings. Notwithstanding, it was evident from the readings taken in the wall, floor and
ceiling of the bedroom and the wall and ceiling of the bathroom, that the areas in the shaded blue on
the moisture survey (Section 5.0) are very wet. Access to inspect below the bath was restricted by the
flooring and bath panel, however the author remains confident that a similar wet situation is likely to be
found in this area also.
3.0 Discussion and Conclusion
There is no doubt condensation is occurring within this maisonette and in particular on the North
Westerly facing external walls, ceiling and floors in the bedroom and bathroom. Thermal Imaging clearly
shows there is a significant cold bridge where the floors project out to form walkways on the North
West Elevation.
The numbers of occupants of this property can also generate sufficient moisture to be a problem if not
managed properly. In the opinion of the author however there is nothing in their lifestyle that appears
to be exceptional or that would cause excessive moisture over and above that created during normal
habitation.
The tenants state they do not have a washing machine or tumble drier as they use the facilities provided
by the landlord for all residents.
There remains three possible factors that could lead to moisture levels to be high enough in the building
to cause the condensation:
 Moisture from the occupants condensing onto the cold areas but never evaporating
fully i.e. this would cause a build-up of moisture that does not dry out.
 Leaks in the walls or windows which is getting into the cavity wall built on the floor.
 Leaks in the asphalt paving covering the walkways that is tracking back under the wall.
 A combination of any of the above factors.
The areas of bedroom and bathroom ceiling & floor shaded in the diagram below are all very wet and
thermal images of these areas clearly show that there is a substantial cold bridge area that will attract
condensation of any moisture laden air within the structure to this point if the structures temperature is
at or below dew point. In this respect the design of the structure was reviewed and is the opinion of the
author that the cantilevered walkways, being located on the exposed North Westerly elevation will
inevitably be at or below dew point for long periods since it is on the prevailing wind and cold side of the
building with no direct sunlight to give thermal warming during the day. The coldest period is usually the
last few hours before sunrise and inevitably occurs when the family is sleeping in the bedrooms
producing moisture. Mr Palmer advised that he uses towels to wipe off the water and mould. He has
been advised that this is likely to spread the mould spores and increase the propensity to infect other
areas. Towels used for this purposes should therefore be boil washed or discarded.
Interstitial condensation will be occurring inside the insulated ceiling and to a lesser extent in the inner
leaf of the cavity wall. Where areas are in contact with the concrete not being able to dry out at any
point as it cannot be absorbed through the concrete.
Whilst the author could not find any definite leak points through the walls and paving, this is not to say
that they do not exist. The asphalt paving on the walkways has at best a 40-year lifespan, after which the
deterioration is likely to have noticeable effects on the structure. In this case we are considering
material that was probably laid at least 60 years ago. The moisture readings in the timber flooring and
lower sections of the wall could indicate either condensation or leaking over a prolonged period. This is
especially evident as the author is of the opinion the timber is suffering from either or both wet and dry
rot and recommend a section of this flooring should be removed and examined to assess which species
of rot is present so that a suitable treatment regime can be put in place.
We were advised there are no electro-mechanical ventilation systems to either the kitchen or bathroom
and is essential in a property that has been retrofitted with uPVC windows and doors and where it has
no other form of passive ventilation to adequately remove moisture created by the occupants during
bathing and cooking.
4.0 Recommendations:
Landlord:
Measures recommended to alleviate moisture related issues at the property and assist the tenants in
controlling internal atmospheric conditions include:
 Consider fitting Electro-mechanical ventilation systems to the bathroom and kitchen.
 Take up the flooring to the bedroom and possibly under the bath to examine for rot.
 Treat or remove all damp and rotted timber following inspection and sterilise all areas.
 Carry out further investigations to determine if the external asphalt paving is life expired and
porous.
 Remove the insulated ceiling sections in the bathroom and bedroom.
 Insulate all cold bridges and external cavity walls in bathroom and bedroom with a suitably
designed system that combats cold bridges and incorporates a vapour barrier to prevent
interstitial condensation.
 Carry out an effective mould remediation treatment using appropriate biocide or fungicidal
washes in accordance with manufacturers guidelines prior to any redecoration.
5.0 Moisture Survey and Floor Plan:
5.1 Occupation:
2 Adults and 5 Children (ages 1, 2, 4, 5 & 9)
5.2 Ventilation:
There is no mechanical/electrical ventilation associated with this property and no passive ventilation
and we therefore recommend bathroom and kitchen ventilation is fitted as a priority to help reduce the
effect of occupational moisture on the structure.

6.0 Observations:
6.1 Lounge:
The evidence of cold bringing taking place at the joints in the
blockwork is clearly evident from the mould pattern shown
her on the LHS of the window in Bedroom 1.
6.2 Thermal wall image:
Despite the very low contrast in temperatures between
the surface temperature and atmospheric temperatures,
this Infra-red imaging shows very clearly the cold lines of
the mort joints in the blockwork inner wall of the cavity.
Dew point at the time of survey was 14.2°C and it can be
seen from the colour chart that the joints in this wall
were at or very near dew point and this was 1 hour after
midday.
6.3 Thermal image bedroom wall:
This infra-red image shows the floor in corner of the
room to the RHS of the window and where it joins the
internal bathroom wall. Temperatures along the floor in
front of the skirting were below dew point at the time of
survey. This might be related to an area of floor that is
wet from a leak in the external paving or a low thermal
efficiency due to being very wet and conducting heat
away into the cold concrete floor. Either way,
condensation was taking place here at the time of survey.
6.4 Bedroom ceiling:
This Infra-red image shows the junction of the dropped
down insulated panel to the ceiling of the bedroom in
the blue shaded are shown on the two diagrams below.
Positions M1 and M2 are almost at and below dew
point which was 14.2°C at the time of survey.
Temp. Refl.Te 7.5
No [°C] Emiss. mp. [°C]
See 6.3 and 6.4 above for positions of M1 and M2 on the
M1 14.3 0.93 20.0
images.
M2 13.8 0.93 20.0
6.6 Bedroom:
Position M1 in the LH corner of the bedroom outer wall
was 13.9°C. Condensation was occurring at the time of
survey.
Temp. Refl.Te 6.7 Bedroom:
No [°C] Emiss. mp. [°C] The surface temperature in the RH corner of the
M1 13.9 0.93 20.0 bedroom at floor level was 13.9°C and was 0.3°C below
dew point at the time survey. Therefore condensation
would have been taking place at that time.
6.8 Bedroom ceiling
The drop down insulated section of the bedroom ceiling
and bathroom had very high WME readings. See section
5.4.
6.8.1 Bedroom ceiling:
The edge of the drop down insulated ceiling which steps
down around 50 mm is viewed and we are not aware of
the precise make up of this but whilst it is clear from
infra-red imaging that the ceiling is have an insulative
affect, it has clearly failed to prevent interstitial
condensation as the entire area of ceiling has WME
readings in excess 25%. Anything over 20% would be
considered detrimental to any organic material in the
room and adjacent to this.
6.9 Bedroom floor:
The timber flooring in the bedroom that covers the
concrete slab has %MC as high as 35%. The adjacent wall
has a WME reading of 90%. The timber in this area is wet
to the touch and has a distinct smell of rot which could
be dry rot. Further investigation are required.
6.10 Bathroom:
As per section 6.8, the bathroom ceiling has been
lowered and presumably insulated to reduce loss of heat
and create a warmer ceiling. Whilst this has worked to
keep the ceiling warmer, it has not been successful as
interstitial condensation is taking place and the ceiling
board and whatever is behind it, is very wet.
6.11 Bathroom:
As above. The WME reading in the bathroom ceiling is
above 25%.
6.12 Outside of Property:
The external access way outside the bedrooms has a
pavement grade asphalt surface which is probably
around 65 years old. The average life expectancy would
normally be around 40 years.
7.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
A Protimeter Aquant BLD5760 moisture detector, using radio frequency survey method, giving readings
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. This gives readings for moisture in materials up to a depth of 19 mm
depending on material characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for
interpretation, therefore they should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
A Protimeter Mini BLD2000 using electrical impedance survey method on wood and other non-
conductive materials. On wood it measures moisture content from 6% to 28%, the level at which the
fibres are saturated. In other non-conductive materials the instrument measures the WME (Wood
Moisture Equivalent) up to 28%.
The WME value is a theoretical moisture level that would be attained by wood that is in moisture
equilibrium with the material being tested. The full measurement range is from 6 to 90 but values over
Readings at depths from surface readings up to 25 mm (Using a hammer probe) can be taken.
Cavity and confined space Moisture readings using a Rotronic, high precision temperature and humidity
probe, together with a fully specified HygroPalm23-A calibrator handheld with full logging functions
Destructive testing:
Actual moisture content: Where a very accurate moisture content is required this is done using an
Ashworth Mears “Speedy” moisture tester that gives actual moisture content by a % of weight of a
sample that is removed from the structure and tested.
Air moisture and where appropriate CO2 readings have been obtained using a combination of a
Protimeter Hygromaster and a Rotronic CP11 or both. Measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity

0095_BH1.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out confirming the structure to be dry (section 5.3 – 5.4) and is
the opinion of the author the reported issues within the flat are due to atmospheric conditions driven by
a lack of ventilation (section 6.0) and the occupational activities with the amount of contents therein
and the drying of clothes within the property. The atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey
under protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’
would point to the occupation being classified as moist (section 5.5)
We are advised there are two adults and three young children living in the property who are mostly
away during the day. We are further advised there are 6 washing loads processed per week which on
occasions are dried outside or within the flat with the aid of a clothes horse located outside bedroom 1
or a line located in the kitchen/diner.
At the time of the survey some of the windows were open but all trickle vents were closed and require
cleaning. The flat benefits from storage heaters which we are advised, all are operational.
Elements of mould were noted on external walls at survey locations B at base, E at base, H at base, J at
base and, O mid wall.",3
0075_RH20.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) through the property and this in general
indicated a dry structure. However, a localised area of damp was noted to the bathroom floor via non-
invasive readings recorded through decorative vinyl flooring. It is the opinion of the author the noted
damp is not a contributory factor to the mould issues affecting the property and probably relates to
occupational activity or possible residual moisture from previous plumbing issues.
With regards to the forced ventilation in the property issues were noted with the units installed in both
the bathroom and kitchen (Section 6.1). A high level of passive ventilation was noted and the tenant
confirmed in general low internal air temperatures are maintained (Section 6.2). Increasing the internal
ambient air temperature will reduce relative humidity levels, improving the current internal conditions.
It is understood a positive pressure ventilation system is to be installed in the property, it is the opinion
of the author these works should be carried out along with addressing the issues noted regarding the
installed extractor units, this will reduce the atmospheric moisture levels in the property further
improving conditions.
The wardrobe to the master bedroom (Bedroom 1) backs on to the wall to the communal hallway a
thermal survey (Section 5.4 & 5.5) showed clearly cooler temperatures in the wardrobe which are most
likely being driven by the influence of the colder wall temperatures in this area. The drop-in
temperature will be a factor in the mould development in the wardrobe. With regards to remediating
this issue it is the opinion of the author efforts to insulate this wall structure could drive interstitial
condensation issues in this area. In the first instance efforts to reduce the internal moisture load plus
increase the internal air temperature should be carried out followed by a further review of the structure
prior to insulating wall structures being considered.",1
0050_ME2.pdf,"A mainly non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the flat which in the main confirmed a dry structure.
In regard to bedroom 1 and survey location point 3, raised surface readings were recorded but, when drilling into the structure, readings were
recorded dry concluding surface condensation is the cause. As to the skirting board in the bathroom, not always having the shower curtain
contained within the bath is the probable cause. In regard to the kitchen and survey location point 9, the likely cause will be as a result from the
water ingress from the flat above the previous year.
As to how the flat is ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in both the bathroom and kitchen, plus window trickle vents.
Within the occupancy section set out below, a “wet” occupancy was calculated.
Within the thermal imaging section set out below, condensation was an issue and calculations made concluded at wall surfaces RH levels were
as such that mould is able to thrive.
Observations did not reveal any significant evidence of mould but it should be highlighted it is understood the tenant is having to clean surfaces
on a regular basis.
In conclusion the concerns of the tenant in the opinion of the author will be associated with periods of raised humidity levels and inadequate
ventilation. This is supported by the underperforming extraction units, results in the thermal imagery section and not allowing for adequate air
circulation behind contents.

0099_BN12.pdf,"We are to understand there is one adult and two children residing at the flat with 3-5 washing loads
processed per week and dried in various locations within the property.
It was observed that there is a drier within the kitchen which appears to be vented internally.
Also within the flat is a Nuaire vent unit which tenant advises was installed prior to her moving in and
not aware of its use. At time of survey, there was power going into the unit but, not able to advise its
efficiency.
With regard to existing ventilation measures, there are trickle vents to the windows some of which were
open at the time of our survey but ideally require cleaning.
A 150mm diameter Advent extraction unit in the kitchen appears to be in a poor condition which at first
was operating however, when switched on a second time, it failed to operate and the tenant advises this
unit indeed malfunctions on occasions. A flow rate of 2.7 m/s was able to be recorded and equates to 47
l/sec which aligns to the current recommended 29 l/sec when adjacent to a hob and just below the 59
l/sec when located elsewhere in this location.
External observations of this unit exiting the building revealed that constant cold air is able to pass
through directly into the kitchen when not in use.
A 100mm diameter extraction unit in the bathroom operates via a pull cord separate to the light switch
and gave a flow rate of 0.6 m/s on test with a one minute overrun. This equates to 4.7 l/sec which is
below the current recommended 15 l/sec for a bathroom with a 15 minute overrun. This unit requires
cleaning and it was also noted the flutes on the outside are open constantly therefore, this could also
allow cold air from the exterior to pass through the unit especially when not in use.
In bedroom 1, mould was noted at base level on the external wall and around the uPCV window. There
were also slight signs of mould to a small section of ceiling in the bathroom and on elements around the
window. In the kitchen above the window and down the side of a wall unit minor signs of mould was
also noted on the external wall.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out throughout the flat with no raised levels recorded.
In conclusion, it is the opinion of the author that the out breaks of mould and condensation is due to a
lack of ventilation / lifestyle issues.",3
0175_MK8.pdf,"A number of areas were pointed out by the owner of the property at the time of the survey, moisture
levels were checked which indicated a dry condition. Observations made at the time of the site visit
would indicate a dry condition through the loss affected areas.
Remote Monitoring was carried out over an eight day period. A review of the collected data
(Section 4.3.1) based on protocols detailed in BS5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation
in buildings, the occupation of the property would be gauged as a damp occupancy. The data collected
would suggest the atmospheric conditions in the roof structure are predominately driven by the internal
atmospheric conditions. It is the opinion of the author during periods of cold external temperatures
condensation in the roof structure is inevitable. Based on the recorded dew point temperatures in the
roof structure and the recorded external air temperatures it is likely condensation occurred in the roof
structure during the monitoring period.
Observations showed the area of staining to the bedroom ceiling correlated with a suggested break in
the continuity of the roof insulation (Section 5.2). Based on the observations made it is the opinion of
the author condensate forming in the roof structucture if sufficient will drain down the upper side of the
insulation material until it reaches a break where it will drip down on to the plasterboard ceiling.",1
0004_BS35.pdf,"Prior to the survey, an assessment of the EPC Certificate suggested a good rating for air tightness and
thermal performance. In addition, a review of the Ventilation Commissioning Certificate appeared to
suggest a Natural Ventilation System may have been the intended system choice however, there were
queries with the content aligned to the ducting, background ventilation, door undercuts and flow rates
as covered herein.
We understand from the resident, the extractor unit located in the enclosed first floor bathroom has
previously malfunctioned and been replaced on a number of occasions with the last remediation
including changing the ducting within the adjoining loft space.
Images shown to the authors clearly showed previous extensive mould through the bathroom hence
leading to the necessary redecoration process. The paint finishes have deteriorated in a small number of
areas and not the walls as a whole possibly suggesting the walls may have been damp in areas prior to
the paint being added and, could relate to the cleaning process if the exercise was conducted within a
short timeline.
Moisture readings both non-invasive and invasive indicated a dry plasterboard structure in the areas of
‘damage’.
One of the affected areas close to the sink was accessed to determine the condition of the cavity
between the bathroom and adjoining walls and, an inspection of the removed plaster and timber-board
structure did not reveal any evidence of mould. A subsequent borescope assessment inside the cavity
confirmed it is in a good condition and also free of mould which could be regarded as an expectation in
the absence of free air circulation in the void even though the surfaces were previously mouldy (section
5.3).
An assessment of the adjoining master bedroom (also being an area of concern) confirmed mould
evident to the upper wall/ceiling area to the right-hand side of the window with a thermal assessment
confirming a likely cold band aligned to possible gaps in the insulation to the eaves along this elevation
(section 5.1 & 5.4). ‘At risk’ readings were noted but likely relate to previous condensation related issues
due to the temperature difference along this elevation.
The double bed was pushed close to the adjoining bathroom wall and, although damp would not be
penetrating the internal wall with dry conditions, it is the opinion of the author any mould related issues
in this room will be attributed to the adjoining bathroom after use due to the fact the resident
confirmed always leaving the door open to clear generated moist air. Moist atmospheres will fill
adjoining rooms due to vapour pressure differentials and, in areas where there is a lack of adequate air
circulation i.e. in wardrobes and behind the bed, these ‘still’ areas can retain this increased vapour level
leading to the development of mould when the atmospheric conditions uphold this.
During the thermal assessment, the plasterboard walls in the bathroom did not reveal any areas of
concern that could result in possible dampness and mould. However, the ceiling next to the extractor
displayed a clear colder band that, at certain times of the day (and year), can lead to periods of
condensation after use due to the temperature difference and resultant mould development potential.
With a dry structure in mind and a recent amendment to the bathroom ventilation (not recorded on the
original certificate), a detailed assessment of ‘ventilation adequacy’ in the property as a whole was
undertaken.
The first observation was a lack of undercut to the internal doors and, in particular the bathroom door
whereby Approved Document F recommends a 10mm gap between the door underside and the floor
finish. With a closed door, this gap allows ‘make-up’ air to enter the room via the undercut and aid the
installed extraction with the drawn-in air combining with the generated moist air and expelling it to the
exterior. In the absence of such, with the door closed the extractor wouldn’t be able to extract as it
would have no moveable air to draw in and expel and would simply make a noise. This could also align
to why the resident leaves the door open to clear the moist air even when the extractor is operating.
An assessment of the loft ducting confirmed a mix of rigid and flexible ducting of considerable length
installed to expel the air and, in the opinion of the authors would significantly reduce its performance
capability due to the lengths of ducting as a whole and the resultant decrease in energy as the air moves
through it. With a lack of energy, warm moist air will likely remain in the ducting and, being located in a
cold environment can, in the absence of recommended insulation, lead to possible condensation coming
from the ducting plus inside the duct dripping back into the extractor unit (section 5.2.1.1).
The bathroom extractor in boost mode exceeded the recommended 8 l/s minimum and, the only
recommendation is to review the overrun timer to increase the background flow to a recommended
minimum 15 minutes to clear the generated moist air.
The kitchen extraction device is an intermittent unit whereby the bathroom is a continuous running
device. Approved Document F recommend devices in ‘wet rooms’ are the same for optimum ventilation
measures through the property aligned to achieving the ‘whole dwelling ventilation rate’ (section 5.2.4).
In addition, the kitchen and WC extractor flexible ducting appears to exceed the lengths also
recommended in the Approved Document F.
In conclusion, the installed extraction units and their ducting require detailed reviews to meet
recommendations stated in the relevant approved documentation alongside possible replacement with
dMEV units as a consideration to align with the bathroom unit. Door undercuts need to be increased to
aid air circulation and the loft insulation is to be inspected to ensure an even and adequate coverage TO
the eaves but NOT in them.",3
0272_TA9.pdf,"A moisture survey was undertaken (Section 5.0) and elevated readings were noted in two key locations
within the property. The main area was the kitchen where the external door to the main building had
been removed.
The kitchen porch is a single skin concrete construction with concrete flat roof and the moisture
generated during cooking will meet the cold external wall surface and condensation will likely form.
Organic matter in this area will act as a food source combined with high moisture encouraging the
mould growth as seen in Section 6.9.
The other internal door from the kitchen has also been removed subsequently allowing excess
atmospheric moisture to travel through the property with the potential spread of mould.
Elevated readings at survey locations J and K, see 5.1.1, would be consistent with atmospheric moisture
condensing around the window areas. With 6 persons and a large dog living at the property the levels of
atmospheric moisture will be high and therefore good ventilation is essential.
It is the author’s opinion that with the absence of any forced ventilation, the high level of atmospheric
moisture is consistent with the level of occupancy and likely leading to condensation in areas of the
structure. No evidence of failed double-glazing units was observed during the property survey and is
more than likely that raised moisture readings at point B, see 5.1, are as a result of localized water
ingress around the base of the door frame and daily traffic.",1
0097_BH21.pdf,"At the time of the survey, we were not able to enter bedroom 2 however, the tenant confirms that there
has been no issues in this room.
Three adults reside in the flat and are out mostly during the day. We are advised that five washing loads
are processed per week which are either dried outside or, in the lounge.
We are advised that neither of the extraction units are used by the tenant and that there had been two
long term leaks one in the bathroom and one from the boiler in the kitchen and could explain the raised
moisture levels noted.
On test however the Expelair 100mm diameter unit in the kitchen delivered a flow rate of 2.9 m/s with a
15 minute overrun equating to 22.78 l/sec which is below the recommended 29 l/sec adjacent to a hob
or 59 l/sec elsewhere. The 100mm diameter bathroom unit delivered a flow rate of 0.5 m/s which
equates to 3.93 l/sec which is also below the recommended 15 l/sec/. No overrun was recorded.
There are clear signs of paint damage and elements of mould development to a section of an internal
wall under the stairs in the cupboard. The opposite side of this wall is in direct line with the bath and
raised moisture levels were recorded in this area. Also noted was a number of contents being stored in
this area. Raised moisture levels to the floor and wall behind the WC in the bathroom were also
recorded along with mould and paint damage and, condensation was also occurring at the time of our
survey. At the end of the bath, a small area is noted where there is no sealant which will allow water to
track down when in use. And, after surveying the bathroom one of the tenants had a shower with the
shower curtain on the outside allowing water to migrate directly onto the lino floor.
Additional raised moisture levels were recorded along the entire length of the wall on the left hand side
in the hall as you enter the flat with the other side being into the kitchen and the location of the boiler.
There are also two separate areas of blown plaster to an internal wall in the lounge adjoining the
kitchen.
Within the kitchen directly under the boiler, mould development was noted along with a section of
flaking plaster. Also noted, was raised moisture levels under the lino covering. At time of the survey, the
boiler was in use heating the hot water and a very low pressure was noted that could relate to an
ongoing leak. Pipes to the central heating system are noted to be above the skirting board throughout.
There were no visual signs of any leaks from pipe work however, directly under the kitchen sink, there is
clear staining to the back of the unit suggesting a leak at some stage.
It is the opinion of the author the likely reason for the high readings, mould and blown plaster can take
into consideration the history of reported leaks to the bathroom & kitchen. With raised moisture levels
and our observations, it is likely there has been little or no drying of the affected areas and, with
possible leaks still occurring, moisture remains trapped within the fabric of the building with the likely
cause of the blown plaster at survey locations C & D being from raised moisture levels from the kitchen
floor. Other factors leading to issues within the property include the non-use of extraction units plus the
units themselves appearing not to meet the required standard and the tenant drying clothes within the
confines of the property.",3
0140_E7.pdf,"We are advised that one adult and three children reside at the flat with one child at school and the
tenant working part time. In addition we are further advised that one washing load is processed once
every two weeks and dried either outside or at the local laundrette.
At time of the survey the majority of the trickle vents to the uPVC windows were open and appeared to
be in good order. A number of the passive vents were however being restricted by contents directly in
front of them (see sections 7.4 thru 7.7).
A detailed moisture survey was carried out (section 5.0) which confirmed the structure to be dry. There
were however slight signs of an element of mould mainly in the corner of the external walls in bedroom
2 to the rear of the flat.
With regard to the mould activity reported in property the areas where mould development was
advised in fact displayed a dry structural moisture condition (Section 5.3). It is the opinion of the author
the moulds affecting these areas are likely to be driven by the atmospheric moisture load in the
property combined with cool surface temperatures leading to raised relative humidity levels and
subsequent mould activity. The atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey under protocols laid
out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point to the
occupation being classified as ‘wet’ (section 5.6).
The instance of restricted passive vents, contents against cold exterior walls and the witness of clothes
being dried in the property will add to the reported issue.
Any mould growth should be eradicated in an efficient manner with the use of appropriate fungicides
used in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions to remove the root system. Failure to adopt a
thorough approach can lead to further outbreaks when the conditions are suitable.",3
0022_GU24.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised his disability aligns to a fixed seat located in the bathroom for showering
that had suffered a long-term leak likely through the fixings. When they inspected the area personally
they advised the interior of the stud wall and associated timbers were rotten and mouldy could well align
to the length of time the seat was installed.
At the time of the assessment, tiling in the bathroom area where the seat is located had been repaired
along with localized lower adjoining walls in the two cupboards with it advised no work was undertaken
in the adjoining kitchen.
A moisture assessment through the main areas of concern revealed potential elevated moisture readings
to the new replacement tiles only and, in order to rule out the possibility of any construction elements in
the tile that could be reacting with the electronic moisture meter, a new tile found in the cupboard was
checked and no elevated readings were noted likely suggesting the area behind the new tiling could still
be wet. However, possible foil backed plasterboard for example cannot be ruled out that could align with
the elevated readings and whether the ingress is ongoing.
In the cupboards where the lower plaster was replaced, dry to only very slightly elevated readings were
noted and could enforce the prediction that no further leaking is occurring.
The only other elevated readings were noted to the kitchen floor to the front of the fridge when compared
to the floor as a whole and could align to the initial leak in the bathroom since we are also advised no
forced drying was undertaken in the property.
Regarding reported mould in other areas of the property, their locations could align to issues with loft
insulation consistency and, whilst the drying of clothes was being undertaken even at the time of the
survey, in the absence of adequate ventilation, any mould growth would likely align to the colder
structural area patterns.
A PIV unit was noted to have been installed and, whilst this may be of use to managing the internal
atmospheric moisture load, advice was given to the residents about drying clothes internally and the use
of the bathroom with the door closed being a recommended alternative to using the living room.
Suffice to add, this everyday activity does not align to the residual elevated moisture readings to area
aligned to the seat issue in the bathroom.
It is envisaged the PIV will indeed reduce the potential for mould development in areas of the ceiling and
wall junctions however, an even surface temperature across all elevations is recommended such that the
loft area is assessed and rectified to uphold a uniform and consistent layment of insulation TO the eaves
and NOT in them to achieve the recommended even temperatures across these elevations.
Forced ventilation in the bathroom and kitchen were tested and the kitchen device does not meet Part F
recommended flow rates and the pull cord function to achieve this in both rooms requires manual
interaction whereby the kitchen cord was out of reach. In addition the ‘wet room’ door undercuts were
found to be below the recommended 10mm gap between the door underside and the floor finish such
that, if the door was closed and window open with the extractor working, it would draw air in from the
outside and expel it straight out. And, if the window was closed and the unit working, it would simply
make a noise as it wouldn’t be able to draw make-up air in to lift the damp air out.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a potential structural dampness issue remaining with
where the seat is installed in the bathroom and, further investigations in this area are recommended. If
possible, were a leak still noted, a stand-alone secure chair could be a deployment option to enable the
tiled surfaces to do their task of repelling moisture.
An inspection of the wall and floor behind the fridge is also a recommendation to be able to check there
is no residual moisture in the structure from the initial long-term leak.",1
0194_PO19.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated dry structural moisture levels through the property in
relation to the plasterboard window reveals. With regard to the window sills, raised levels were
indicated in regard to the sill to the master bedroom. The property does not benefit from trickle vents to
the window unit’s and passive ventilation is only achieved by opening the windows. A review of the
forced ventilation highlighted an issue with the exhaust duct to the centralized unit (Section 6.3) and
was addressed by the author at the time of the survey.
Based on the observations and readings recorded it is the opinion of the author the issues being
experienced by the occupants is being driven by internal atmospheric moisture levels as opposed to
weather ingress. Internal atmospheric levels are normally driven by occupational activity and insufficient
ventilation.",1
0145_EN3.pdf,"This is a mid-terrace property of solid brick construction and upon approaching the property the front
court yard is noted to be flagstone slabs which are fitted up tight to the property with no apparent fall
away from the front elevation. It is evident the property at some point has undergone damp proof
injection and has been carried out within the first row of bricks which is only approximately 75mm from
the floor level. The product has been injected into the brick and not the masonry which could allow
finger tracking of the ground moisture. Also noted was the garden wall, which is constructed of brick
and attached to the front elevation, has no vertical DPC to prevent moisture bridging from this wall to
the main property.
On entering the property damp issues are observed to the low level walls and in particular to the dining
room. The tenant advised that corrective works for damp were carried out to this room 2 years ago
when sections of the walls were re-plastered and the bitumen floor was renewed. However, the skirting
boards were not removed and the bitumen was poured up to them. It is possible that any trapped
moisture within the original concrete floor could remain trapped and with the skirting remaining in
direct contact with the original floor, could be allowing residual moisture to wick up behind the skirting
boards and into the low level walls.
It was noted the bathroom within this property is on the ground floor and when inspected it was
apparent they suffer condensation problems within this area due to the evidence of mould
contamination. When checked the forced air extraction unit to the bathroom did not work (see section
6.6) and the atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey under protocols laid out as per BS
5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation
being classified as moist (see section 5.5).
During the survey the neighbour appeared and was asked if his property suffered any damp problems in
particular to the adjoining wall to which he confirmed he did but entry was refused to examine further.
The neighbour also indicated his property was always wet with condensation indicating he could have a
leak within the property, however further investigation would be needed to determine this.",1
0085_SO53.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating areas of structural moisture and
areas of atmospheric moisture with particular attention to the areas of concern highlighted by the
tenant as detailed on the floor plan.
It is the opinion of the author, the most likely cause for the elevated moisture readings to the base of
the wall in the lounge and kitchen at survey points 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16 & 17 plus, elevated readings to the
base of the partition walls to the sitting room survey point 3 & 20 and, elevated readings to the floor
are due to moisture bridging the cavity to the base of the front and flank walls of the property. It is
possible moisture is travelling across the cavity to the internal walls and floor.
In addition, the most likely cause for damp and mould along the flank wall to bedroom 1 and bedroom 3
is due to elevated atmospheric moisture in part due to non-functioning forced ventilation.
The damp staining/patches at the head of and around the edges of the side door frame appear to be
working as designed and moisture is able to track around the door to the inner wall.
Elevated moisture readings were noted to the floors throughout the property, in particular floors that
have been tiled and subsequently covered with vinyl. The elevated readings can be related to the
construction of the floor in a property of this period however it would be prudent to check the integrity
of the plumbed systems for any minor leaks.",1
0002_BN43.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed where possible throughout the flat which confirmed a
dry structure (section 4.0).
In regard to how the flat is currently being ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units in
the bathroom and WC and a three-speed cookerhood in the kitchen which is likely to be a filter unit
only. There is a mechanical extraction unit in the kitchen which was not working at the time of the
survey and, the WC room is used to store contents only.
Observations clearly confirm the outbreak of mould on a number of the uPVC windows and associated
reveals plus external wall surfaces at low level mainly within the lounge and bedroom 2. In the same
rooms, cooler areas have formed between contents and wall surfaces as confirmed with the thermal
survey (section 5.0)
In conclusion based upon observations made and recorded moisture readings revealing a dry structure,
it’s the opinion of the author the issues raised by the tenant is likely to be associated with a combination
of a build-up of colder areas forming behind contents on wall surfaces and inadequate ventilation during
periods of elevated internal humidity levels.

0037_LU3.pdf,"The tenant reports mould on external walls first reported approximately four years ago in both
bedrooms then gradually spreading to other rooms within the flat and are further advised that twice a
year the council attend and wash walls.
A moisture profile throughout the flat (section 4.0) gave no elevated readings and very little contents
were noted throughout the flat that could restrict air movement.
The provisions for ventilation are trickle vents which were open at time of survey however, all require
cleaning and, there are passive vents in the bathroom and WC but these do not appear to vent to the
exterior and also require attention as they appear to be blocked.
We are advised that clothing is dried either on the balcony or on a clothes horse around the flat.
Within bedroom 1 mould was noted around the uPVC window, the top of the ceiling in the corner at
survey location point A and the skirting board.
In bedroom 2, mould was noted around and above the uPVC window and on both internal and external
walls at various heights. Areas of mould noted were noted in the hall to a section of wall that backs into
a communal corridor. And in addition, mould was noted in the top corner of the internal and external
wall in the kitchen and at the base near the gas meter. An element of m was observed to the skirting
board within the lounge directly behind where the sofas back onto the balcony.
Based upon readings and observations made it is the opinion of the author that elevated internal
atmospheric conditions and a lack of adequate ventilation are the likely cause of the mould outbreaks.
The drying of clothes on a clothes horse will introduce elevated atmospheric conditions.",3
0094_W12.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey (Section 4.0) has been carried
out through the property in relation to the areas of
reported mould affecting the structure. Some elevated readings were noted however, it is the opinion of
the author based on the thermal survey (Section 5.0), condensation is the likely driver for these noted
areas of concern.
With regard to the ceiling to the bay window in the lounge, significant mould activity was noted,
however it is the opinion of the author based on the observations made (Sections 5.1, 6.3 & 6.4),
rainwater ingress is not the driver for the noted mould. Rather, elevated internal atmospheric moisture
in conjunction with the cold structure of the bays roof are the driver for the mould caused by producing
elevated water activity levels and periods of both interstitial and surface condensation all of which will
produce the conditions required.
With regard to the control of the humidity levels in the property, significant issues were noted with
regard to both bathroom and kitchen forced ventilation and associated flow of make-up air into these
areas (Sections 6.1.2, 6.1.3 & 6.1.4). These issues should be addressed to allow the tenant to better
control the humidity levels in the property.
In conclusion it is the opinion of the author the mould issues affecting the property are primarily driven
by elevated internal atmospheric moisture levels which are in turn driven by occupational activity and
issues with the effective ventilation of the property. The high atmospheric moisture levels are
interacting with the colder surfaces in the property driving the noted mould.

0180_N20.pdf,"The area of loss appears to have dried out well and no longer appears to be damp. The solid floor
throughout on the ground floor gives elevated readings, expected from a property of this age but does
not give reason for concern. Elevated readings at points I and J at the wall floor junction are directly
below the point of loss.
Two areas have given raised readings on the external walls. Firstly, in the ground floor WC a point
approximately 200mm by 200mm directly below the wall vent and parallel to the adjacent window at
wooden gatepost bolted to the wall. Moisture may be penetrating the solid brick wall at this point in a
localised spot.
The second appears to be a low level band of elevated readings on the external wall below the landing
window. There is a 150mm high step to the upper part of the landing above the height of the original
point of loss. The entire wall and window on the landing were recorded as being about 3°C above the
external air temperature. Therefore, it is the authors opinion that condensation may be occurring on the
landing wall at low level.",0
0087_SS15.pdf,"Several moisture readings were recorded throughout the flat which in most areas confirmed a dry structure. Where readings were slightly elevated
this is likely relating to floor coverings acting as part of a DPM.
Regarding how the flat is ventilated, it was noted there are working mechanical extraction units in both the kitchen and bathroom which vent to the
exterior. In addition, passive trickle vents noted are considered to be in a poor state of repair but open and, passive wall vents in both bedrooms
and the kitchen were observed but, do not appear to vent to the exterior.
There is slight evidence of mould mainly around window reveals and to the trickle vents. In addition, there is some decorative spoiling in the form
of staining on wall surfaces mainly in the kitchen which in the opinion of the author, is probably associated with surface condensation (see
observations).
Within the thermal imaging section set out below, either condensation was occurring in a number of areas at the time
In conclusion the evidence of mould and decorative staining mainly on wall surfaces are in the opinion of the author, likely driven by periods of
raised internal humidity levels and inadequate ventilation and, the conclusion is drawn from a dry structure, underperforming extraction units and
calculations made within the thermal imaging section.
It is recommended all passive vents are investigated for cleanliness and effectivity with venting to the exterior and, installed forced ventilation units
are compliant with Part F of the building regs for resident utilization. In addition, both forced vent units are sited close to windows and, residents
should be advised to close windows when they are operating and vice versa in order to clear the room of atmospheric moisture.

0009_CM9.pdf,"A moisture survey was initially undertaken throughout with
elevated readings recorded to the floor within the
bathroom which appeared to have just been in use. Low
level walls within the bathroom were also displaying
elevated readings possibly due to moisture being able to
migrate beneath the lino from using of the bath and
wicking up the walls.
Elevated moisture readings were also recorded to the entrance wall behind the tumble drier which was
emitting a large amount of heat at the time of the survey. The wall within the bedroom which the tumble
drier backs onto were recording slightly elevated readings and could align with condensation.
The installed ventilation within the property was tested with the bathroom operated via a pull cord
extracting a flow rate of 22.3 l/s which can be considered adequate if and when in use.
In the kitchen the device in constant mode extracted a reading of 4.2 l/s with 34.2 l/s recorded utilising
the boost function which is below that recommended in Part F of the Building Regs.
A flat wall PIV unit is noted in the lounge that ideally should be sited in the hall or cupboard with it able to
introduce air from the outside, filtered and diffused before it is distributed internally. This unit will require
an assessment with Nuaire for its delivery compliance.
A tumble drier was in use at the time of the survey not vented to the exterior consequently emitting large
volumes of heat into the atmosphere with the machine itself showing 46.4oC and the rear showing 71.7oC.
This elevation of atmospheric temperature will encourage condensation especially in winter months when
external walls are colder and windows less frequently opened.
Of note, observations included large volumes of contents against external walls in the majority of rooms
that can restrict air circulation behind them leading to periods of condensation due to the colder structures
the air comes into contact with and, a half full bath of water that remined in place during the survey and
can increase the atmospheric moisture load.",3
0053_ME4.pdf,"A non invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the property which revealed a dry structure.
Regarding ventilation measures, there is a mechanical extraction unit in the kitchen but no unit in the bathroom
however, there is a passive wall vent which was closed at the time of the survey. In addition, passive trickle vents
were noted with all closed but, a number of windows were open.
Observations did not reveal any evidence of mould but, understand the surfaces were cleaned recently of which
there was evidence at survey location point 1. In addition, at survey point 8, there was clear evidence of staining to
wall surfaces and, in the opinion of the author, are likely to be consistent with periods of condensation.
In conclusion the concerns raised by the tenant are, in the opinion of the author, driven by periods of elevated
humidity levels and inadequate ventilation mainly supported by a dry structure, an under-performing extraction unit
in the kitchen and no such unit in the bathroom.

0231_SS16.pdf,"A moisture survey carried out (section 4.0) indicated internal walls and the inner leaf of external walls
both show elevated levels of moisture predominantly from floor level to midw-height on each elevation.
The ceilings all show relatively low levels of moisture and drilled readings taken from areas free of
thermoplastic tiles within the floor slab show elevated figures which would likely indicate ground
moisture whereby the thermoplastic tiles could be acting as a form of DPM. However, missing tiles in
some places and would suggest the DPM is not entirely effective. In addition, domestic water pipes are
buried within the screed and these may require testing to confirm any possibility of leaking into the
ground supported poured slab and subsequently wicking up into the internal plastered walls.
With regard to ventilation, all the trickle vents were closed at the time of the survey. Electric extractor
units in the bathroom and kitchen are manually operated (see section 7.0) with the former indicating an
adequate flow rate for its location although this was not initially functioning. Neither extractor has an
overrun facility and conditions within the bathroom suggest its limited use.
In addition a large static air vent runs from the back of the fireplace in the lounge through the cavity to
an external wall and this will likely inadvertently cause cold bridging deep into the core of the structure
further contributing to the buildup of condensation within the property (see section 8.2).
In the lounge a tumble dryer was noted (section 8.8) and the tenant advised that when in use the unit is
vented to the exterior. With no fixed ventilation, the advised 8 washing loads processed per week relies
on the tenant to ensure adequate ventilation. The atmospheric conditions indicated during the survey
under protocols laid out as per BS 5250:2002 ‘Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’
would point to the occupation being classified as ‘moist’.
Intrusive investigations of the external walls revealed dry cavity wall insulation present suggesting the
DPC is effective.
It is the opinion of the author the high internal moisture readings and mould within the structure are
due to a combination of occupational activity, lack of forced ventilation, structural design with regard to
the external static vent and a cold floor which is exposed in areas.",1
0230_SS16.pdf,"We are advised by the tenant that 5/6 washing loads are processed per week and dried throughout the
flat on radiators. All the uPVC windows were open at the time of the survey and are fitted with trickle
vents. Those located in the lounge were closed but all require cleaning to ensure their optimum
efficiency.
Wall mounted Envirovent units are fitted to the exterior walls in the kitchen and bathroom and both had
isolator switches and were noted to be dirty. The kitchen unit was isolated at the time of our survey and
the tenant advised they do not use the vent in this area due to it being noisy. On test we noted the unit
benefits from a ‘boost’ mode and the flow rate recorded on boost was 1.6 l/min. For a 100mm diameter
unit, this equates to 12.57 l/sec and is below the recommended 29 l/sec adjacent to a hob and 59 l/sec if
sited elsewhere. When boost mode is deselected the unit has a continuous mode and a flow rate of 3
l/sec.
In the bathroom the vent unit operates in the same manner as the kitchen but was in operating in
continuous mode during the survey. On boost mode test, the flow rate was 3.9 m/s and equates to",3
0244_SW6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry structure, however raised levels were noted
with regard to the walls to internal walls to the toilet. Dry levels were indicated with regard to the floor
structures with raised levels noted in the bathroom and toilet which may well be due to occupational
activity.
The atmospheric conditions and thermal survey carried (Sections 4.3 & 4.4) showed clearly
condensation was not occurring in the property at the time of the survey. With regard to the lighted
window reveals increased resultant relative humidity levels were noted in areas where external wall
temperatures were influencing the association air temperature, increasing the likelihood of mould
development.
Windows and trickle vents were open at the time of the survey this was having an influence on the
internal environment. Possible issues were noted with the operation of the extractor unit to kitchen
(Sections 6.0).
With regard to the remote monitoring (Section 5.0), the occupancy was graded as ‘Moist’.",1
0068_RG1.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) through the property and this in general
indicated a dry structure. However, a localized area of damp was noted to the bathroom wall structure
where the walls have been recently retiled (Section 4.1) plus, the base of the walls in the adjoining
toilet. Observations would tend to rule out an ongoing water leak, however possible historic water leaks
associated with the bath seal may well have been an issue prior to the recent works being carried out.
With regard to the bathroom area it may well be prudent to have trades check the plumbing in this area,
certainly under the bath.
Damp was also noted to the base of the exterior walls running through the lounge and bedroom one at
low level with observations tending to suggest periodic condensation in this area as a likely cause for the
noted damp.
With regard to the floor through the property, in general dry readings were recorded although an area
of damp was noted next to the toilet at survey location ‘3’. It was noted in the two bedrooms the floors
have been overboarded with chipboard (Section 4.2) and raised moisture levels were noted in the
chipboard that may well relate to interstitial condensation.
With regard to the forced ventilation in the property, major issues were noted with regard to the forced
ventilation to the bathroom and the associated toilet (Sections 6.1.3 & 6.1.4). The issues noted point to
the installed units being totally ineffective in venting these areas. Issues were also noted with the siting
and ducting to the PPU unit installed in the entrance lobby with the issues noted would quite possibly
nullifying its effect of the unit on the internal environment (Section 6.1.5). With regard to the Kitchen
area it was noted this does not benefit from forced ventilation.
It is the opinion of the author the issues noted with the installed ventilation is the primary driver for the
issues being experienced by the tenants.
Possible issues were noted with the cavity wall insulation to the flank wall to the lounge/master
bedroom (Sections 5.2 & 5.4)",1
0269_TA9.pdf,"The main problem wall in question is the ground floor lounge wall adjoining the side
passageway. This is a solid brick wall having no cavity and is therefore uninsulated. The plaster
has blown on the inside face, the reason for this defect is unknown, although it might be related
to the fact that it is a solid wall construction and is therefore uninsulated.
It is quite apparent from the moisture readings taken at lower levels of the wall along the
passageway are damp up to about 400 mm from floor level. These readings are fairly consistent
throughout the property and are indicative of a problem related to wicking of moisture below the
DPC into the floor screed and then back into the wall. There might also be an element of
moisture rising up through the sub floor concrete into the screed however in my experience the
main problem is very often related to the manner in which the floor screed has been laid in
relation to the level of the DPC. Please see detail below showing moisture pathway.
Mrs Kempson advised me that her neighbours also had similar problems and had reported similar
problems. An examination of the stop valve in the street suggested that one valve serves up to
four properties and that this is located in the pavement directly outside the passage between the
properties. This suggests that there could be a leak on the water main serving these properties
and this therefore requires further investigation.
Specific Humidity (SH) internally average at 7.32 g/kg air when the external SH was 6.3 g/kg
air. This indicates that there is unlikely to be additional sources of moisture entering the property
other than that created by the occupants and that identified at low level in the walls at ground
floor.
I noted that a disabled shower unit is located in Bedroom 2 and that there is an extractor fan with
this; however the shower is apparently not used very often. There are no other extractor fans
located in this building and ideally this should be addressed with a fan in the bathroom and the
kitchen that extract to external air as there is no efficient way of allowing occupational moisture
to escape the property. This fact coupled with a positive pressure unit (PPU) in the unvented loft
space will only serve to create a ""Battery"" storing condensed moisture in the loft space during
cold weather that is then returned back into the property particularly during the day when the
roof void heats up with sunlight.
My recommendation is to remove the PPU completely, especially since it is also a health and
safety risk in the event of fire.
Diagram of how moisture can bridge via the floor screed
There is a definite risk of interstitial condensation occurring in the front cavity wall which faces
north. Currently the cavity wall insulation appears to be dry however relative humidity in the
wall was currently 73.52% of the air temperature in the cavity at 16.11° C the specific humidity
was 8.3 g/kilogram of air would give a Dew Point inside the cavity at 11.38° C. There is
therefore a propensity for moisture to condense out the atmosphere in the cavity. However this
risk would be lowered by good ventilation to the internal fabric that prevents moisture build up
internally that will create a high vapour pressure.
An examination of the roof void shows that there is no ventilation to this property within the roof
space. The loft insulation is in a mess",1

Scope
Following instruction from ………………………., attend the above property to carry out an investigation into
reported damp affecting the basement store area.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a retail unit part of a terrace which opens
on to Brushfield Rd. to the front and Old Spitalfields
Market to the rear. Solid brick construction observations
would suggest the property dates from 1889. The
basement area to the property is original to the structure
and is of brick construction. It is not certain if the
basement is tank only the brick structure was evident to
the exterior walls which are assumed to be earth
retaining with regard to the front and rear elevations.
2.0 Incident:
A water ingress has been noted by the client to the
basement a moisture survey of the structure has been
requested.
It was confirmed by the staff working in the shop water ingress to the basement has been ongoing since
the beginning of October 2014
3.0 Conclusions:
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated raised structural moisture level to the rear and front walls to
the basement plus the rear to the front of the basement under the path.
An active foul water ingress was identified affecting the rear / office area to the basement this
emanating from under the timber flooring to the office area. The basement areas to the two adjoin
properties were accessed no obvious evident of a foul water ingress was noted. Significant level of stock
are in the basement including the office area this would have to be removed prior to any further
investigations being undertaken. It is recommended the floor structure to the office is lifted this will
allow a clearer understanding of the water ingress and allow the area to be cleaned a sanitized.
A water ingress was also noted to the front of the property affecting area under the front elevation of
the ground floor structure to the left hand side as viewed from the front. Cast iron rain water drainage
runs down through the structure in this area, the noted water ingress may well be weather related.
Further investigation of the detailed water ingresses affecting the front and rear of the basement
structure is recommended.

5.1 Upper wall structure - survey location C:
At the time of the survey the coldest surface within
the survey area was 5.8°C, the calculated dew point
temperature for the atmospheric conditions was
3.1°C. Condensation was not an issue in the
basement area at the time of the survey.
6.0 Observations and relevant information:
6.1 Active water ingress:
Sewer chamber to rear of store area, it was noted foul
water is continually draining from the floor area under the
timber flooring to the rear office area in to the opened
chamber located under the door threshold to the office. A
very strong sewage odour was noted in relation to the
water and office floor structure.
6.1.2 Invasive investigation:
An accessibly section of the floor timber flooring to the
office was lifted adjacent to survey location ‘E’ were a
vertical cast iron soul pipe is located. Lifting the floor
section did not high light any obvious issues with the soil
pipe but did clear show the effects of the sewage water
affecting the rear of the basement / office area is
significant.
6.1.3 Access to office floor structure:
Significant levels of stock area stored in the basement this
was certainly the case in the office area. It is
recommended the timber flooring is lifted this will allow
the point of ingress to be better understood plus allow the
are to cleaned and sanitized it is the opinion of the author
the loss water affecting s part of the basement does pose
a health hazard.
6.1.4 Adjoining basement areas:
The basement areas to the adjoining properties were
accessed with the permission of the occupants, this was
to carry out a brief inspection to see if the foul water
ingress affecting the survey property was also affecting
the adjoining areas.
Pictured is the toilet area to the adjoining basement to
the left hand side of the property as viewed from the
front adjoining survey location ‘E’.
Pictured is the area under the timber floor to the
basement area in the adjoin basement to the right hand
side of the surveyed property adjoining survey location
‘H’.
In both adjoin areas no obvious evidence of foul water
ingress was noted.
6.2 Ceiling and wall structures survey location C - D:
Significant water damage was noted in this area,
observation would possible suggest this is area is subject
to an active water ingress which may well be weather
related. Running down through the structure above this
area is the cast iron down pipe to the rain water drainage
to the front of the property. As previously stated in
section 4.2 the structural elements located under the
pathway to the front of the property displayed high
structural moisture levels.
7.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on none wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.
Non-destructive Protimeter Surveymaster 200 REL(PS) or below in masonry guide only

0173_ME8.pdf,"The moisture survey (Sections 4.0) indicated in general a dry structure. However, raised moisture levels
were indicated in a number of areas. The indicated moisture in the structure is not related to the
original loss, rather localized on-going issues with the structure. The areas displaying raised moisture
levels were not the main areas displaying decorative failure. The thermal survey (Section 5.0) showed
condensation was not an issue at the time of the survey, however noticeable cooler surfaces were noted
in the survey areas which could well be subject to condensation when internal atmospheric moisture
conditions are elevated and colder external temperatures are being experienced.
Samples of the skim plaster were taken for off-site analysis, with the aim of identifying any residual
restoration related chemical or hygroscopic salts which may have been deposited in the skim plaster
during the loss or the subsequent restorative process.",0
0224_SO18.pdf,"For a prolonged period of time the southern facing cavity wall has been susceptible to water ingress
through the open head of the gable. Remedial intervention appears to have been effective however the
mineral fiber batts are still wet and require drying. The external brickwork has been coated with a
hydrophobic coating.
It is therefore the authors opinion that staining on the internal plaster surfaces and elevated readings
are due to this free moisture.
The gable wall directly benefits from high solar thermal gain which may gradually dry the insulation over
time however, an injection drying program where warm air from a desiccant is passed through the cavity
would accelerate this process.
Observations made with a thermal camera suggest that in bedroom 1 an insulation batt may be missing
as a cold spot on the wall above the bed correlates in size with a Rockwool batt at 1200mm x 455mm.
Uninsulated, this will leave a cold spot on the wall where condensation may occur, see section 5.2.
High readings in the kitchen floor seem to be related to a possible leak in the plumbing around the sink/
washing machine area and therefore is not considered related to the moisture in the gable wall.",1
0014_DA11.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) this highlighted a dry structure apart from a
gable end wall, with regard to the first-floor master bedroom a plumbing issue has affected the
structure. Elevated readings were also noted to the ground floor affecting the gable end wall through
the lounge and kitchen areas. Penetrating damp (Section 6.2) may well be a driver for the noted
condition.
It is the opinion of the author elevated atmospheric moisture levels a primary driver for the mould
issues reported through the property. Significant issues were noted in regard to the background passive
ventilation through the property and the forced ventilation to the Kitchen area in particular. The free
flow of make-up air into forced ventilated areas plus effective background ventilation of the property is
essential in controlling atmospheric moisture levels and associated mould activity.
Restorative Drying: With regard to the areas of the structure affected by the plumbing issue these area
need to be forced dry, via the application of a tented drying process. To this end as requested the
following restorative drying works are detailed.
 Enabling works: Move contents as required from the affected area, remove from site loss
affected insulation and insulated plasterboard drying. As required remove vapour barrier from
affected structural elements. Treat as required mould growth through the affected area.
 Restorative drying: Installed a tented focused drying process, process to include period
monitoring visits through the process. The process will be concluded by the final moisture
survey and subsequent report.",1

several areas where moisture had affected the property and cracks had started to appear in sporadic
places (see Section 5.8).
Upon investigation it was noticeable the majority of damage is to the west facing elevation and was
apparent the property at some time had Helifix strapping system installed to combat this. To the
exterior a glass movement meter had been fixed to the stone work to indicate movement (see Section
5.3), and it was also noted to the exterior that repointing had been carried out in places and, around the
lounge bay window, gaps had been filled in with expanding foam and are in direct line with the moisture
pattern (see Sections 5.4 and 5.5).
During the inspection moisture readings were taken and the areas that appear wet due to staining are
exactly that and is the opinion of the author it is staining from an existing water leak. There is a
particular stain to the lounge ceiling which is directly under a previous leaking radiator which has now
been repaired (see Section 5.7).
The most severe wet area is to the sitting room at high level and this is in direct line with the expanding
foam fill to the exterior likely indicating moisture ingress (see Sections 5.4 and 5.5).
Within the bedroom there is a wet area of approx. 500mm2 at high level with mould contamination and
is in direct line of a disused stone chimney (see Section 5.1) which without further investigation could be
allowing moisture to ingress.
At the time of the survey atmospheric conditions were taken both inside and outside the property and
the interior was found to be within acceptable conditions (see Section 4.2).
With regard to property movement, it is the opinion of the author, as the property is sited around large
hills and the ground is mainly clay, when heavy rain falls the water table alters likely causing water to
travel from the mountains underneath the property and down the valley. This would potentially affect
the foundations causing movement as there is evidence of cracking and sloping to the west (front)
elevation of the property (see Sections 5.2 and 5.6).",0

Scope
Following instruction from …………………, attend the above property to investigate moisture related issues
affecting floor and wall structures through the ground floor.
Report
1.0 Property
The property is a large detached dwelling reported to be
constructed off a reinforced piled concrete floor slab.
Cavity wall construction finish to the exterior with brick
work up to the ground floor window sill level and
rendered and decorated above.
It is reported the property was built in two phases due to
a change of contractor. The first phase incorporating
ground works up to and including the installation of the
reinforced piled slab was completed in 2008.
The site was then shut down until 2013 when the build was recommenced and completed in 2014.
Design changes were incorporated when the build was restarted in 2013 and are reported to include
changing to a timber frame construction from the original brick and block design plus remodeling of the
internal layout.
2.0 Incident
Since moving into the property in 2014 the owners have been experiencing raised moisture levels with
regard to areas of the floor screed through the property and the uninsulated concrete slab to the
internal garage area.
3.0 Conclusions
The survey of the property showed clearly the gas proof membrane/DPM to the floor structure will
cause loss water to be retained within the floor structure. Once in the floor structure, the water will
migrate through capillary action up the wall structures to affect the associated screed floors. Two main
areas of structural detailing were identified which would cause ongoing water ingress into the floor
structure, namely the cavity trays/DPC installation and the detailing of the membrane to the garage
floor.
A previous minor water leak on the washing machine to the kitchen areas was reported by the owner
however in the opinion of the author this is not a contributory factor.
The checks carried out on the ‘live’ high pressure plumbed systems through the property confirmed
their integrity.
With regard to the waste water systems through the property, the drainage is largely un-serviceable and
un-testable as there is a lack of access points on the drain connections and changes of directions to the
external waste system.
3.1 Recommendations:
A drainage company should carry out full CCTV Survey and advise on how to make the drainage system
serviceable and testable. Remediation works should be carried out to allow the integrity of the system
to be confirmed and allow the system to be maintained in the future.
4.0 Observations and relevant information:
4.1 Wall and Floor slab construction:
The following detail has been formulated from observations made on site, supplied information and
suggested manufacturers recognized specification. The actual design may well differ from that depicted
however the relationship of the critical elements affecting the loss is known to be accurate.
The section view is developed on observations made in relation to the rear conservatory where a block
work internal leaf is noted to the cavity wall construction. As mentioned the design was changed to a
timber frame through the main areas of the property. Observations made with regard to the DPC/DPM’s
would suggest their as-built installation in consistent throughout the wall and floor structures through
the property.
Inner leaf to cavity wall plus cavity insulation
Cavity tray / DPC with weep hole install in outer leaf
75mm Floor screed over laying 75mm insulation
Gas membrane / DPM to floor construction
Pilled reinforced concrete floor slab
4.1.1 Design and noted issues:
Gas membrane / DPM to floor construction:
It is reported the property is built on an old industrial site which is reported to be contaminated
requiring the installation of a gas proof membrane. The membrane installed extends across the surface
of the piled slab and is turned up in the exterior wall cavities where it is lapped into the DPC/Cavity tray
to the outer leaf of the cavity wall. Observations made during the survey would suggest the detailing of
this membrane is good with folded corners noted as opposed to cut and jointed corners. It is
understood the membrane used is designed to act as a DPC to the internal wall structures not requiring
the installation of a hyload DPC at the points where wall structures have been built off the membrane. It
was noted the gas membrane is effectively acting like a pond liner and any water entering the structure
will be captured and retained by the membrane.
Cavity trays / DPC to outer wall structures:
This detail was noted around the property and water penetrating the outer wall structures will be
captured by the trays around the perimeter and discharged to the exterior by the weep holes installed.
However due to the installed gas membrane the detailing of the cavity tray is critical and any issues with
drainage and sealing of joints and corners will allow water to drain down into the floor structure.
4.1.2 Indicated moisture in floor screed and water in slab construction:
Observations made through the property highlighted a range of moisture levels with regard to the floor
screed, ranging from reasonably dry to wet. It was noted areas displaying raised levels were associated
with installed wall structures plus areas where walls were originally planned to be installed.
Excavated floor to Kitchen/Dining area:
One of the main areas of concern is a line of persistent
damp across the kitchen where a wall was originally to be
installed. This area was excavated during the survey
which highlighted the structures as indicated in
‘Section 4.1’. To the right of the excavation in the floor
structure was the line of brickwork which would have
formed the base of the wall which was not installed. To
the top of the picture is the timber frame wall to the
adjoining lounge area, under the foot print of this wall
was a buildup of what appeared to be a celcon block on
its side over laid with the floor screed which extends
under the wall structure. Both the redundant brick wall and block/screed under the timber frame wall
were providing a route for capillary moisture to migrate from the gas membrane up to the floor screed.
In the room areas 75mm foil backed celotex insulation is installed under the floor screed, celotex will act
as a DPM isolating the screed from underlying moisture. However celotex will degrade with long term
exposure to moisture. As pictured the floor screed and redundant brick wall etc. were found to be
saturated when the floor structure was opened plus a film of standing was found on the lower gas
membrane.
4.1.3 Issues noted around the structure which will allow loss water to affect the floor structure:
Installation of the weep holes around the property:
Pictured is a weep hole to the rear conservatory and was
noted the weep holes are installed on the mortar bed as
opposed to being installed directly on the cavity tray
which lies under the mortar. This means any loss water in
the tray has to achieve a depth of 10 – 15mm before it
will drain to the exterior. Loss water building up behind
the mortar will tend to travel along the tray until it finds a
point where it can drain and could be at a joint in the
length of the tray or at a corner detail.
Cavity tray corner detail to rear conservatory:
The corner was opened to allow the detailing of the tray
and lower gas membrane to be checked. As stated the gas
membrane appeared to be in good order however the
two trays meeting at the corner were not sealed and
would allow water in the tray as this location to drain into
the floor structure. It was also noted the tray and gas
membrane were installed short of the outer edge of the
wall structure and is not a good detail allowing the DPC to
be bridged by the mortar bed.
Detailing of Gas membrane regarding integral garage:
Images supplied by owner of the property taken during
the construction of the property.
The gas membrane running through the floor structure
also encompasses the garage area running under the
uninsulated floor slab. The supplied picture shows the
membrane extending to the front edge of the floor stab,
which extends out beyond the garage door up to the block
paving to the front drive.
Rain water ingress:
During periods of heavy rain water puddles on the block
paving and is reported to enter the garage under the up
and over door. An ‘Aco’ has recently been installed across
the front of the garage in an effort to limit the effects of
rain water on the garage. However the new drain has
been installed to the front edge of the slab.
Rain water affecting the floor slab to the garage area is
likely to affect the gas membrane in the slabs
construction.
4.2 Leak detection checks undertaken to confirm the integrity of plumbed systems.
Reported historic plumber issues:
It was reported by the owner there has previously been a minor water leak from the washing machine
to the kitchen area, however this was quickly identified and rectified. The reported issues with regard to
the damp floor structure were an issue before the minor reported washing machine leak and is the
opinion of the author the reported leak is not a contributory factor.
4.2.1 Inspected heating system.
The heating system pressure was at 1.5 bar at the time of
survey. The homeowner noted that the system had not
been topped up in month whereby the system would lose
pressure if a leak was present and can confirm the system
is not leaking.
4.2.2 Pressure tested the internal cold water services.
The incoming mains water pressure was 5.5 bar at the
time of survey. The cold water services were isolated and
pressure tested at 5.5 bar. No loss of pressure occurred
and can confirm the cold water services are not leaking.
4.2.3 Pressure tested the hot water services.
The hot water services were isolated and pressure tested
at 5.5 bar. No loss of pressure occurred and can confirm
there are no leaks on this element of the plumbing
system.
4.2.4 Pressure tested the incoming water supply.
The incoming water supply was isolated and pressure
tested at 5 bar. No loss of pressure occurred and can
confirm there are no leaks present on the supply pipe.
4.2.5 Inspected the drainage.
There is no suitable access into the drainage systems to
test or service them and the image shows what drainage
is visible. The reader should note there are no chambers
down the Eastern elevation. Foul water drains should
have a minimum of an inspection chamber at every
change of direction and these appear to be missing on
this scheme.",0
0278_TN24.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted significant moisture levels in relation to the gable end
flank wall down through the property which is in line with the reported observations made by the
owner. Raised moisture levels were indicated in relation to the exterior flank wall to the rear kitchen
area, plus the ceiling structures associated with the chimney to the first floor bathroom. With regard to
the affected areas to the flank wall, raised moisture levels were not affecting the associated front and
rear elevations.
With regard to the damp ceiling structures to the first floor bathroom the affected areas may well
suggest weather ingress associated with the flashings and/or roof detail and further investigation would
be prudent.
With regard to raised moisture levels noted to the gable end wall, it was also noted there are two
distinct zones affected. Firstly, through the ground floor area including the exterior wall to the kitchen
area and is the opinion of the author the moisture affecting these areas is ground related with possible
penetrating damp also affecting the lower wall structures. Bridging of the slate DPC was noted (Sections
7.2 & 7.4) and is assumed damp wall structures are present behind the dry lining to the ground floor
lounge and dining areas and is reported damp remediation works have previously been undertaken
through these areas.
The second zone is to the gable end wall through the loft area extending down through the upper wall
structures to the first floor and moisture noted in the upper wall structures may well be related to the
suggested issues with the previously removed cavity wall insulation.
Gravimetric tests carried out in the loft area in relation to the inner leaf of the cavity wall indicated very
low free capillary moisture levels which would tend to suggest an ongoing moisture ingress is not an
issue, however high Hygroscopic levels were indicated which may well be the cause of the elevated
readings indicated. Further gravimetric tests in other areas may well be prudent with both brick and
mortar being sampled.
Hygroscopic salts present in the wall structure will be directly affected by the atmospheric moisture
levels in the property. Raised atmospheric moist levels were not noted at the time of the survey
however comments made by the owner would suggest this could be an issue.",1
0163_LU4.pdf,"Regarding water ingress, pooling of water on the communal flat roofs due to blocked drains appears to
have overflowed penetrating the party wall over the past few years. Evidence of wet roof joists (section",0
0083_SO50.pdf,"We understand one adult and a large dog reside in the property with it noted the kitchen is an open plan
layout with the lounge. No visible areas of damp and mould were noted at the time of the survey and the
front windows were open with no trickle vents noted.
An assessment of the areas of concern being the bedroom as pointed out by the occupant, did not suggest
any raised moisture levels in the structure or the carpet area as pointed out.
A localized area of the bedroom wall indicated staining that could suggest previous condensation likely
during the colder periods This construction was solid at the base and potentially dry wall further up the
wall. The staining relates to the solid aspect and, could well cool during the winter leading to the
condensation when the room is not ventilated adequately (section 5.4).
A review of the existing ventilation installed confirmed an MVHR unit is installed and, was isolated at the
time of the survey.
assessment should be considered to make 100% sure there is no stagnant water in the system prior to it
being made operational. Ideally, it shouldn’t be turned on even for a short period with this also applying
to a PIV system.
When the MVHR unit is off, the property will not be ventilated properly and, raises the potential for mould
alongside increasing the levels of other indoor air pollutants. A check of the EPC rating for this property
indicated good air tightness meaning the operation of the MVHR system is even more critical in protecting
the health of the occupants and the structure itself.
On test the unit measured in the wet rooms confirmed flow rate of:
Bathroom: 7.3 l/s
Open-plan kitchen: 11.5 l/s Total: 18.8 l/s
In background mode this unit should deliver a total of least 19.8 l/s into all Habitable Rooms while
simultaneously extracting the same rate from all wet rooms. In addition the system should be capable of
boosting so that extract from the kitchen is at least 13 l/s and the bathroom at least 8 l/s.
A review of the door undercuts also suggested a close level to the recommended 10mm gap as defined in
Approved Document F whereby it is recommended they are checked and adjusted for full compliance
since the property has an internal bathroom and an open-plan kitchen.
It is the opinion of the author, the issues experienced by the resident during the winter is likely to be
aligned to inadequate use of the installed ventilation measures upheld by its non-use at the time of the
survey and the confirmation of mould on contents which is only sustained by internal atmospheric
conditions.",3
0174_MK41.pdf,"The WC is located on the gable side of the property and is sited under the stairs with access from the
entrance hallway.
On entering the WC it is apparent the room is suffering from a damp problem with visible mould
contamination and wet walls at low level. During the inspection it became apparent that prior to its
conversion, the WC was used as a food cold store. The room has no ventilation with a forced air unit or
opening window and its use is likely to contribute to the high atmospheric conditions within the room
(section 4.2). This can also lead to instances of condensation to the pipework wetting the structure.
The WC is lower than the entrance hallway and entering is down two steps into the room. Upon
measuring the bottom of the window sill to the exterior of the property it became apparent the floor
within the toilet is 220mm below the ground floor level thus creating a cellar effect and possibly
rendering the DPC non-effective within the WC area and, could readily explain the high moisture content
at skirting and low wall level to the exterior walls within the WC.
It was mentioned to the Technician that the property has undergone cavity wall injection insulation
within the past 4 weeks but only to the ground floor level.
It is advised by the author that to rectify the damp problem within the WC it would be recommended to
take off the skirting boards, hack off the plaster at low level and apply a tanking solution to a level above
the existing exterior DPC then re-instate the area. It would also be advisable to introduce a forced air
extraction unit or an air brick vent to allow for adequate ventilation of the area.",1

Following instruction from …………………., attend the above property to investigate reported high
moisture levels and associated mould affecting the bay window to the bedroom area.
Report
1.0 Property:
13c is a first floor flat in an end of terrace property, solid
9” brick construction.
2.0 Incident:
It was reported during the period of significant rain fall
which occurred at the end of 2013 in to 2014, the gable
end wall to the property was affected by significant rain
penetration. Restorative drying and redecoration have
previously been carried at the property, with regard to
the affected gable end wall. During the restorative works
the owner of the property was in temporary
accommodation. Upon returning to the property mould activity was noted affecting the bay window to
the front bedroom area, this area was not originally part of the insurance claim.
3.0 Conclusions:
The bay window structure to the bedroom was inspected, the moisture survey (Section 4.0) showed the
bay structure to be bay in general to be dry. There was some minor evidence of damp to the front
elevation of the bay up under the window unit this is likely to be due to a minor water ingress. The
thermal survey showed the single skin structure to the bay is noticeable affected by the exterior
temperature the structure was significantly chilled that condensation was an issue. Moisture readings
were also recorded from the front elevation to the property in the adjoining bathroom and associated
walls to the bedroom dry readings were noted through these survey areas.
It is opinion of the author based on the moisture and thermal surveys under taken raised relative
humidity levels and occasional periods of condensation is the driver for the mould activity noted. Mould
activity was noted to both sides of the bay structure and the net curtains.
The survey highlighted movement between the bay structure and the brick front elevation to the
property (Section 6.1).

at the time of the survey.
6.0 Observations and relevant information:
6.1 Bay construction:
Observations showed there has been movement in the
bay construction in relation to the building structure. This
has possible occurred when the replacement UPVC
window units were installed to the ground floor. Evidence
of misalignment was noted with regard to the UPVC
flashing to the UPVC window unit. Significant cracks were
noted between the first floor bay structure and the brick
structure to the front elevation.
6.1.1 Cracking to right hand side of the bay:
The pictured crack is to the right hand side of the bay as
viewed from the interior. Cracking was noted to both
sides of the bay however the cracked to the right hand
side was such that day light was clearly evident through
the crack.
6.2 Mould activity:
The main driver which allows moulds to develop and flourish in and on the materials within a structure
is moisture or, to be precise, water activity. Materials can become damp in a number of ways, directly
being wetted, moisture penetrating materials through capillary action, physical contact and hygroscopic
materials absorbing moisture directly from the atmosphere.
There are many hundreds of mould varieties each requiring different levels of water activity to allow
them develop and flourish. The lowest known level of water activity at which mould can be active is
0.61. In general this level collates to an atmospheric relative humidity (RH) of 60%. Condensation does
not have to form on a surface. For there to be sufficient moisture to allow mould to become established
at the point where condensation occurs, the relative humidity will be 100%.
Moulds are simple fungi from several groupings in the fungal classification system. Sexual reproduction
in some fungi allows genetic modification to adapt and tolerate changes in the environment such as
humidity, temperature and food requirements.
There are three principal features common to the broad range of mould:
1. Simple food requirements: able to exist on non-nutrient materials such as plaster and brick
which have traces of contaminating organic matter
2. Produce vast number of spores which allow rapid adaptation to particular environments
conditions and rapid colonization of other suitable locations within an enclosed environment
3. Grow very quickly under suitable conditions. The main requirement for the development and
growth is a source of moisture although food, oxygen and a suitable temperature are also
important.
Moulds can be regarded as hydrophilic fungi (tolerating high water availability) although individual
species have their own optimum requirements for moisture. In most situations where surface
condensation occurs and or the relative humidity of the internal atmosphere exceeds 70% (0.7 aw) for
an extended period, mould growth will be established.
Mould is an opportunist and once established in a property will quickly colonize areas with
appropriate conditions. Most properties through their normal occupational cycle will have periods of
high occupational moisture however it is the prolonged periods which will allow mould to develop.
Once mould is present in a structure the period of time it will take to colonize new areas is reduced
due to the increased level of spores being produced in an enclosed area. In many cases a process of
mould removal is required to allow a satisfactory out comes to changes in occupational activity when
trying to prevent further mould activity.
8.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on none wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.
Non-destructive Protimeter Surveymaster 200 REL(PS) or below in masonry guide only
Non-destructive Tramex MRH Masonry scale 40 REL(TM) or below in masonry guide only
Invasive moisture readings Plaster and Masonry WME 16% or below guide only
Invasive wood readings Below 15%

0209_RH19.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) highlighted significant moisture in a number of areas through the
ground floor with the main location being associated with the raised floor area through the kitchen,
shower and associated hallway plus in particular, the shower room rear wall to the bedroom and the
chimney. The reported area of concern to the front bay displayed high moisture levels however this
location appears to be isolated from the main affected area. Further invasive investigation is therefore
recommended in particular with regard to bridging of the wall cavity.
Observations highlighted original detail with regard to design barriers to ground moisture migration into
affected wall structures (Section 5.2). It is the opinion of the author moisture in the ground under the
floor slabs in particular the upper floor slab will have an easy route of migration to affect the inner wall
surfaces.
Moisture readings and observations indicated previous damp remediation works have been carried out
which appear to have been unsuccessful. This is the case at survey location ‘L’ to the bedroom area
where loss moisture has climbed up the wall through capillary action affecting the plaster finishes above
the level of previous remediation.
An ongoing water leak within the area of concern may well significantly increase moisture levels under
the floor structure which would highlight weaknesses in the design leading to the issues being
experienced. The survey highlighted minor issues with the shower and chimney however it is the
opinion of the author these are not solely the cause of the loss moisture in the structure rather a
contributory factor.",0
0162_LU3.pdf,"We understand two adults reside at the address each working varying shift patterns. Washing loads are
reported to be twice per week and dried with the aid of a convection dryer.
At the time of the survey all trickle vents were closed and on inspection were found to be in a fair
condition. No forced ventilation was apparent throughout the property and on entering the address, the
conditions felt warm and humid and it was noted the occupants were cooking at the time.
The tenant advised the council carried out insulation works to the property a couple of years ago and
state they have had this problem since that time but, when asked what work was undertaken, he could
not recall.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out confirming the structure to be dry (section 5.1 – 5.4) and is
the opinion of the author the reported issues within the flat are due to atmospheric conditions driven by
a lack of ventilation (section 6.2).
At the time of the survey the atmospheric conditions indicated under protocols laid out as per
‘BS5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings’ would point to the occupation
being classified as borderline ‘moist’ (section 5.5).",3
0024_GU31.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0), this has identified a number of areas where
elevated structural moistures levels area present which would be expected considering the age of the
structure. Observations would indicate damp remediation works have previously been carried out in a
number of areas through the property, with elevated readings noted at depth (REL(PS)) and
corresponding low to moderate readings noted in the skim plaster (%WME). In regard to the highlighted
areas to the front elevation and the rear utility room where decorative failure has occurred salts analysis
identified significant levels of both Chlorides and Nitrates which would tend to suggest ground related
moisture is affecting the skim plaster in these areas (Section 6.2).
In regard to the area of concern within the built-in wardrobe to the master bedroom condensation was
shown to be an issue at the time of the survey (Section 5.3). In addition, the corresponding area to the
lounge below survey location ‘G’ displayed elevated readings floor to ceiling. It was noted the render
and decoration to the front elevation terminates at the corner of the building, is detail could allow
penetrating damp to be affecting the structure (Section 6.3). If this is the case it is likely to be affecting
both the first and ground floors. It should also be noted what appears to be cabling has been installed
through the lower wall structure in the areas of survey location ‘G’ this will also possible compromise
the previous remediations works carried out.
With regard to the condensation noted to the wardrobe, a number of issues were identified in regard to
the ventilation provision through the property (Section 6.1). Namely there appears to be no forced
ventilation in the Kitchen and ensuite, plus the installed fan unit in the shower room does not comply
with the required flow rate.
In the highlighted area to the rear bedroom survey locations N – P, no elevated structural moisture was
indicated. Observations would suggest the mould affecting his area is being driven by elevated
atmospheric moisture level in conjunction with cold wall surfaces.",1
0270_TA9.pdf,"It is evident that the occupants live in a building that is overly congested with their possessions. Their
occupation style is chaotic It might cause some health issues and could be considered a hazard to health
of the occupants, especially in the event of fire, this is an issue that can be addressed by them alone but
it is not in my view a factor that is contributing to the problems of mould in the property. It was
however a factor that prevented me from surveying only those areas that were reasonably accessible.
Therefore, I cannot be certain that I have found all areas that might be contributing to the problems.
Notwithstanding I am confident that those areas that were capable of being surveyed have revealed
sufficient evidence to arrive at my conclusions below and that if addressed will go substantially to
reducing the negative factors that are causing the damp and mould problems.
Whilst the principal driver for the mould is condensation from moisture generated by the occupants, the
lifestyle of the occupants is not in my opinion the root cause of this. It is inevitable that occupants will
generate moisture, but the solution is to remove moisture before the atmospheric conditions get to
levels that become detrimental and cause condensation. Whilst condensation will always occur on
surfaces that are at or below dew point, it does not necessarily become a problem unless it is
continuous, always in the same places and that there are mould spores or root systems present in the
areas that are getting moisture.
Mrs Fisher advised that her son tried to clean up the mould in the bathroom. However, I believe that in
doing so he might have inadvertently spread the spores around. The evidence for this is the fact that the
mould is occurring on the external wall above the tiled area which is a known cold bridge of this building
design, caused by the solid concrete cavity closure units. There is also mould on the party wall above the
tiles and whilst this is probably colder than other walls where it joins the loft, it is not usually
significantly that much colder since it is heated from both side. I believe this has happened by spores
being transferred during cleaning. Likewise, the mould spores behind the WC are also caused by
condensation from moisture in the bathroom and possible wiping down. The flow rate of the extractor
fan has been checked and found that this is inadequate and only extracting at the rate of 6.3
Litres/second and with a very short overrun. The fan was also very dirty and required cleaning out,
however the poor flow rate is probably caused by a poor quality fan. Notwithstanding, the ducting
should also be cleaned.
The tenants do have a tumble drier located in the kitchen. This is ducted out of the building and will
therefore not be delivering moisture into the living compartment. It is my opinion that the lack of mould
downstairs in a kitchen that does not have any extraction systems, might be because the tumble drier is
helping create a warm but well ventilated area downstairs, however this is not the right form of
ventilation for a kitchen. It is therefore recommended that an extractor fan is installed in the kitchen
that gives a minimum of 30 litres/sec over the cooker or 60 litres/sec if remote from the cooker.
In Summary:
This building is suffering typical problems found in structures where retrofit systems have been
randomly added over the years without adequate controls being put in place to manage the changes
occupational moisture that would not normally have been a problem if the original design and
construction had remained the same. Those factors being:
 Loss of open fires and flues that previously encouraged ventilation in favour of central
heating.
 Replacement of draughty windows and doors with new UPVC frames with air tight seals.
 Life style changes of occupants as a consequence of having on demand central heating
when previously the buildings would normally have been kept at a lower temperature and
compensated by wearing more clothes indoors.
 Re-roofing properties that possibly did not have any sarking felt but were well ventilated
well through the tiles.
 The introduction of cavity wall insulation and the sealing in or blocking to the cavity with
cavity wall insulation when previously the air flow in the cavity encourage extraction of
moisture from the structure.
 The blocking off of passive ventilation either by the introduction of CWI or sealing by
occupants to save heat loss and prevent draughts.",3
0279_TN26.pdf,"It was confirmed by the owner, loss water never entered the property above the floor level with the
indicated loss being a leak to the main water supply external to the property (Section 7.1). The water
from the mains leak will have increased the localized ground water conditions however, If the DPC’s and
DPM’s to the property are functioning correctly, ground water conditions will not affect the internal
structure. Observations made at the property would suggest a high water table is a common situation in
the area of the property (Section 7.3).
The moisture survey carried out indicated raised moisture levels through the property, however the
thermal survey showed condensation was an issue in the property at the time of the survey and was
certainly the case where the mould activity was first noted to the lounge area at survey location ‘E’ as
drilled readings indicated the wall structure was dry (Section 4.1.1).
The survey indicated a lack of ventilation was likely to be an issue at the property (Section 6.0) plus, the
owner’s hobby of breading reptiles is also likely to increase the atmospheric moisture levels in the
property.
It is the author’s opinion the moisture supporting the mould activity in the property does not relate to
the reported loss to the mains supply. Rather the mould is being supported by atmospheric moisture
conditions driven by occupational activity and exacerbated by a lack of ventilation.",0
0253_TA6.pdf,"From an examination of the guttering system and the cavity wall to the rear of the property on
the right hand side of the entrance door, it is apparent that these areas are excessively damp from
the overflowing gutter. I am of the opinion that the main problem of damp in this building is
resulting from these overflowing the roof valley gutter. You will note from the pictures below,
showing the rear walls to the other properties, that this block of apartments are all suffering from
a similar problem. There is clear evidence of water staining appearing at the same area on each
apartment.
It can be seen from the picture below at 7.6 showing the height and location of the end of the
valley that water not only gets into the roof verge detail but it is likely that the water is actually
getting down into the cavity wall at this very point, not only through the face of the brickwork
but also directly into the cavity. Further examination is required in this area to give a full
diagnosis of the point that the water is entering the structure.
Is my opinion that the reason why UFFI is not present in the area to the right-hand side of the
entrance doors where the water is directly hitting the wall, is that it is due to excessive water
degrading the foam over many years to the point that it is now completely degraded. Elsewhere
within the property the UFFI has still degraded substantially but not completely to the extent that
the reduced quality of the foam is now having very little insulative effect upon the property.
UFFI was effectively banned from use in domestic properties during the mid-nineteen eighties
due to offgassing of the product causing possible health risks to inhabitants. It is not unusual to
find a property of this age with UFFI being present in the property and in my experience most
times where I have come across UFFI I have found that the property tends to suffer from damp
internally. This is in my opinion usually due to the fact that the UFFI has prevented the cavity
from having an air flow through which could remove moisture and allow it to disperse or dry out.
As the phone breaks down its density reduces and with this and the voids created there is a
greater propensity for interstitial condensation. I therefore recommend that the UFFI be removed
completely from the property and an alternative means of insulation is sought. We would be
happy to recommend a specification for insulation to this property based upon a possible change
in design to such things as ventilation roofing et cetera.
I found that where the cavity was visible the wall ties where dirty (with old construction mortar)
and in particular the lower levels where the cavity meets the floor slab, the cavities where
bridged with mortar droppings. These should be cleaned out.
There was no insulation in the roof void above the rear of the lounge bedroom, hallway and
bathroom. I also suspect that there is no insulation in the sloping roof either. However the
composite roof system has been fitted onto battens placed over a board of some type. This board
might well be an old insulation board, although I suspect that given the age of the property it is
unlikely to be anywhere near the standards which would be relevant at the time of writing this
survey.
Moisture readings in the wall in table 6.4 below are generally in the dry range except for the
lower levels up to about 600 mm above the floor. Moisture levels in the floor are high and are
highest at the rear of the property where the water is overflowing the gutters and whilst levels
(REL readings) do not get down to what I would consider to be dry levels, below 200 they do
reduce a little the further you get away from the leaking area at the rear walkway.
The plaster to the lower 300 mm of the wall has softened and broken down due to the action of
moisture over a prolonged period. This should be hacked off and re-plastered.
There are high moisture levels in the lower section of the bathroom tiled walls. It is my opinion
that these are as a result of leaking in the tile grouting where the shower has been washing over
the wall.
The construction of this apartment is on top of a reinforced concrete slab covered with a sand
and cement screed over the garages below. The dirty cavities at low level will be prone to having
water getting in and seeping in the floors where the water levels build up. Much of the floor is
covered with thermoplastic floor tiles acting as a DPM. I suspect these might have been removed
in some areas or have broken down, as the tenant had been placing polythene sheeting under the
carpet to try and prevent moisture coming up through the floor. However it should be noted that
even with a DPM in place on the floor, without removing the source of the water getting into the
structure it would definitely just rise up the walls to a much higher level than it does currently, as
there would be a lesser drying effect at floor level and would then only be via the walls.
Had this studio apartment been at ground level it would have been worse since it is likely that
there is some drying effect taking place from the underside of the floor in the garages below.
Although it should be noted that this is an assumption as I was unable to access the garages to
inspect the soffit below.
The ventilation provided to the bathroom by the mechanical/electrical fan was in my view
adequate for this property which has a low occupancy. The ventilation to the kitchen does need
improving as the fan was only performing at about half that required under current building
regulations. Areas of sealed lofts with no ventilation can cause problems and therefore any future
design should take this into account.
In summary
Whilst the design and construction of this building would not conform to current building
standards, it could be made dry and adequately insulated, provided the leaking roof and
overflowing gutters are corrected and the building thoroughly dried out. The existing UFFI in the
cavity walls should be completely removed and the roof and walls insulated in a manner so as to
prevent any interstitial or reverse condensation. I suggest that in order to meet current standards
The 2010 Conservation of Heat and Power regulations are implemented.
It will also be necessary to provide adequate ventilation to the roof void, as an unventilated cold
roof void can give rise to condensation unless adequate vapour barriers exist between the
unvented/unheated roof space and the living accommodation. Likewise the floors should be
insulated and the vapour barrier upgraded to prevent condensation from the cold floors as the
garages will be unheated.
Note:
The property is situated on the corner of a road that has open country side in the direction of
prevailing winds. It is my opinion that this property is in a very exposed position. I would not
recommend this property for full fill cavity wall insulation at any time as it is built in a category
4- Severe Exposure Zone in a very exposed position. Cavity insulation in walls with this type of
brickwork should at best be insulated in Zone 2 areas or below.",1
0207_RH10.pdf,"Two adults and two children reside at the property and we are advised two washing loads are processed
per week and dried with the aid of clothes horse and radiators. The tenant added there is no facility to
dry clothes externally. All windows have trickle vents fitted and although they appeared in a good
condition, none were open at the time of the survey.
The forced extraction units were assessed and both were isolated at the main switch. In the kitchen we
note a 100mm diameter Vectair extractor unit emitted a flow rate of 2 m/s which equates to 15.7 l/sec
with a 12-minute overrun. This does not align to the recommended flow rate of 29 l/sec in a kitchen
when fitted adjacent to a hob and 59 l/sec if fitted elsewhere with a 15-minute overrun.
In the bathroom a similar unit failed to operate and therefore could not be assessed for its effectiveness.
With a noted dry structure in the main, all the above issues will lead to elevated atmospheric conditions
in the property that will likely result in condensation and mould growth.
Mould growth in the child's bedroom would appear to be as a result of atmospheric conditions in the
room and is supported by reported mould growth to clothes items also in this location.
Observations of the underside of the kitchen cupboards where the tenant highlighted the damp smell
showed signs of mould growth on the plasterboard behind the cupboards and further investigations
revealed there was a leak to the back of the fridge approx. one month ago. This was evident as the
plinths either side of the fridge are saturated, split and also showing signs of mould growth. It may be
that the resultant moisture in the structure is leading to mould growth to the backs of the cupboards
and walls where a lack of air flow and cold still air will be prevalent.",3
0206_RH10.pdf,"Following a full moisture survey, data gathered indicated the property walls are dry except for a
localized area noted behind the base units to the kitchen area at location L (see section 5.3 & 6.2). It is
the opinion of the author this area may well be subject to condensation during periods of high humidity
in the kitchen area.
With regard to the floor structure, non-invasive floor readings were recorded through the thermoplastic
tiles which show a range of readings throughout the property, some of which are elevated. The tenant
regularly mops the floors on a daily basis. The thermoplastic tiles will act as a vapour barrier restricting
evaporation from the sub-strait. It is the opinion of the author the indicated levels in the floor are not a
factor in the moisture supporting the reported mould activity.
The thermal survey highlighted a significant band of cold affecting the lower areas of the wall structures,
floor surfaces and associated contents. In general the mould activity is localized to this area. The
property does not have additional decorative flooring installed, only the original thermoplastic floor
tiles. It is the opinion of the author this is a factor in the cold noted.
Due to the layout of the property it is essential the extractor systems are operating to the optimum.
Issues were noted with both the kitchen and bathroom units which will influence the use and
effectiveness in controlling internal moisture loads.
Based on protocols specified BS 5250:2002 (Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings)
the remote monitoring data collected would indicate the property has a Moist bordering on Wet
occupancy. It is the opinion of the author during colder periods when natural ventilation would vent to
be less it is likely a Wet occupancy would be indicated.
Therefore it is the author’s opinion that occupational moisture levels combined by the effects of cooled
surfaces are the drivers for the mould issues being experienced through the property.",3
0156_KT6.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated the loss affected area to the basement caused by the water
ingress extended further than the area highlighted by the failure of the decorative finishes. Salts analysis
carried out (Section 5.1) suggested the loss water affecting the structure is directly rain related. The area
of water ingress correlates with the front building line to the upper structures (Section 5.2)
Pictured is the wall/floor junction between the exterior
wall to the ground floor structure and the block paving.
What appears to be a ‘Bituthene’ membrane or similar
was noted to the edge of the block paving adhered to the
brick structure. Detailing issues were suggested which
may well be allowing loss water to migrate past the
membrane to affect the structure below. It is
recommended the block paving and associated elements
are lifted to allow clear access to the waterproofing
system and should be remediated as required.
In the basement area it is recommended the wall finishes are stripped back to allow focused drying of
the loss affected areas post remediation works. A period of time (dwell period) should be allowed prior
to reinstatement to ensure the waterproofing works undertaken have been successful.",0
0059_PO1.pdf,"In regard to the mould outbreaks, this develops behind the wardrobe in bedroom 1, on internal wall
surfaces, at the base of the internal wall by the front door, within the storage cupboard and on contents
of which, we are advised photos have been sent to their landlords.
Furthermore, the tenant confirms water ingress has occurred on four separate occasions, two from the
flat above and two from the flat roof.
A non-invasive moisture profile was carried out throughout the flat which confirmed a dry structure.
However, an isolated elevated reading was recorded to the floor surface within the bathroom which
could relate to an internal leak and should be investigated.
In regard to ventilation installed in the property, there are working mechanical extraction units in both
the bathroom and kitchen with both requiring attention (section 6.1 & 6.2). Trickle vents are fitted to
the windows most of which were open at the time.
Observations revealed some isolated areas of mould development (section 6.0) and a common theme
through the property was the placement of contents in front of colder external walls. With little or no air
circulation behind the items, warm air in the room can reside on the colder wall surfaces which can lead
to periods of condensation. The thermal imaging survey (section 5.0) confirms the presence of cold
bands at the time.
The tenant reports the flat appears to be cold and not able to maintain heat. Observations confirmed
there is a car park directly below the property such that cooler surfaces is to be expected.
In conclusion, based upon a dry structure, observations made of the property layout and the thermal
images suggesting cold spots are prevalent at the time, it is the authors opinion that a build-up of cooler

areas behind contents, and inadequate ventilation are the likely causes of the issues highlighted by the
tenant. This is also endorsed by the assessment in accordance with BS5250:2002 Code of Practice for
Control of Condensation in Buildings: Annex B Moisture Generation and Ventilation in Occupied
Buildings (section 4.6) suggesting a ‘Moist’ occupancy that could align with a lack of ventilation through
the property. The indication moiuld has affected contents items is important as it confirms the
outbreaks are due to internal atmospheric conditions and not structural moisture.",3
0088_SW6.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the loss affected rear area to the hair salon. Raised
moisture levels were indicated throughout the rear area certainly in the side areas survey points A & B,
active condensation was shown to be an issue in these areas by the thermal survey undertaken.
Conditions appeared to be moderately better towards the rear of the property survey locations E & F.
Mould activity was noted as an issue throughout the rear with a significant musty odour noted upon
entering the property.
The atmospheric moisture levels and recoded surfaces temperatures indicated condensation was an
issues plus the relative humidity levels recorded throughout the property would be sufficient to sustain
mould activity. With regard to relative humidity this will increase as air cools, reasonable cold surface
temperatures were noted to the rear of the property. The air adjacent to the cooler walls and ceilings
will be cooled to the structures temperature this will increase the relative humidity which intern will
encourage further mould activity.",1
0132_DT4.pdf,"We understand one adult and two children reside in house with adult currently not working. There are
7-10 washing loads processed per week and either dried outside or on the landing with aid of a clothes
horse. Passive vents are noted to the bedrooms none of which are able to be opened however their
actual function is questionable (section 7.2 & 7.3). In addition nearly all the uPVC window trickle vents
were closed and again, not able to open. A number of windows were also closed at the time of the
survey.
The loft space was visually inspected with revealed roof felt and loft insulation has been topped up to
approx. 200mm thick. This insulation appears to cover the entire floor surface but we are not able to
advise if this extends to the eaves. A thermal imaging survey (section 6.0) revealed a number of cold
spots at the top of the external walls apart from the gable end wall and aligns to areas of reported
mould in the property. The thermal survey also revealed condensation was occurring in some areas at
the time.
In the kitchen a 125 mm diameter extractor unit operates via a pull chord separate to the light switch.
On test a flow rate of 1.8 m/s was recorded, equating to 23 l/sec with a 15 minute overrun. The flow
rate is below the recommended 29 l/sec adjacent to a hob and 59 l/sec sited elsewhere. However, with
no reported issues in this location, the overrun is likely to be of importance and any future reported
issues may require the overrun to be extended.
In the bathroom the 100mmm diameter extraction unit recorded a fan speed of 1.7 m/s which equates
to 13.35 l/sec and is just below the recommended flow rate of 15 l/sec in a bathroom with a 15 minute
overrun. However it was determined that 3.2 air changes per hour are made by the unit and is below
the recommended 6 – 10 air changes per hour for a bathroom.
A detailed moisture survey confirms the structure to be dry and a visual inspection of the exterior
brickwork did not reveal any major defects.
It is the opinion of the author the mould outbreaks are likely being driven by atmospheric conditions as
a result of occupational activity with a lack of forced ventilation likely to be a contributing factor. The
presence of mould to the landing window (section 8.1) is also indicative of atmospheric conditions.
Areas where the static vents are located may also be contributing to cold walls leading to the inset of
mould (section 7.2 & 7.3) and their functionality and alignment with the exterior is not confirmed.
The cold tops of walls noted in the thermal images (Section 6.0) is possibly a detailing issue with either
the loft and/or wall insulation where gaps may be evident at the wall/ceiling junction and is consistent
along the front and rear elevations beneath the soffits.",3
0035_LU2.pdf,"A non-invasive moisture profile was completed throughout the property which confirmed a dry structure
(section 4.1).
The tenant’s only current issue is mould development within the fitted wardrobes which has been a
repeated case during colder months from the time of commencing residency and, observations confirmed
this was indeed currently case (section 6.0).
A thermal survey of the wardrobes (section 5.0) clearly revealed colder surfaces and, calculations made
confirmed humidity levels at the base of the walls in the units were such that mould is able to be sustained.
Regarding how the property is currently being ventilated, there are working mechanical extraction units
in both the kitchen and bathroom. Passive trickle vents to the windows were all noted to be closed and,
a passive vent in the kitchen, whilst appearing to vent to the exterior, the face vent appears to be
permanently closed.
Observations revealed some clothing being dried within the lounge and contents in front of external wall
surfaces.
In conclusion based upon a dry structure, observations made and a review of the thermal images, the
author is of the opinion the issues highlighted by the tenant is attributed to inadequate ventilation during
periods of elevated internal humidity levels leading to warmer moist air entering the wardrobes and,
when close, reside on the colder external walls leading to periods of condensation and hence the mould.",3
0139_E7.pdf,"We are advised nine adults reside at the property with a number who are mostly at home during the
day. The property has the benefit of uPVC windows and trickle vents, a number of which were open at
the time of our survey. We understand there are 10-14 washing loads processed per week which are
either dried outside or throughout the property.
A 100mm diameter Envirovent unit was fitted in the bathroom and on test a flow rate of 3.4 m/s was
recorded. This equates to 26.71 l/min and although is adequate for this location, it did not have an
overrun whereby 15 minutes is recommended.
In the kitchen a 150mm extraction unit operated via an isolation switch recorded a flow rate of 2.5 m/s
equating to 44.18 l/min and is adequate if located by a hob but was located elsewhere and is therefore
not adequate for this area again with no overrun.
A moisture survey of the chimneys was carried out which revealed raised moisture levels at the base to
the ground floor only. It was noted the chimney pots appear uncovered, thus exposed to the elements.
This could allow rainwater to run down the chimneys and settle at the base. In addition a visual
inspection of the exterior did not readily reveal a DPC and is likely to be covered by the bitumen painted
around the perimeter of the property (see section 7.6). However, assuming a DPC is evident, it may be
possible it is being bridged by the individual hearths and further inspection may be necessary.
Therefore the probable cause of raised moisture levels noted at base of the chimneys to the ground
floor could possibly be due to the chimney pots not being capped and a potential bridging issue with the
hearths cannot be ruled out.
Noting mould has been evident in the first floor bedroom chimneys and since these are cold walls,
atmospheric conditions cannot be ruled out either as a contributory factor for mould growth during
colder months. With a number of adults in residence, the use of ventilation measures and their
effectiveness is vital during these periods.
At the time of this survey (June 2015), based on BS 5250:2002 Code of Practice for Control of
Condensation in Buildings, the occupation would be classed as a ‘moist’ occupation. Atmospheric
conditions in a property are mainly driven by occupational activity and is the opinion of the author,
atmospheric conditions would be a major factor in relation to the mould issues being experienced in the
property particularly to the first floor.",3
0288_TR15.pdf,"I am in no doubt that the reason for the condensation occurring on the front edge ceiling is the
moisture load at night within the bedrooms being such that the Relative Humidity is high and this
gives rise to a Dew point that is at or above the surface temperature of this edge of the ceiling.
The solution is two fold:
1) A rigid insulation of Celotex 100 mm thick can be installed between the rafters for 300
mm wide with the leading/front edge chamfered back to match the slope of the roof, so
that this is in contact with the ceiling and covering over the wall plate on the inside skin
of the cavity. I spoke with John Kilcourse from site and discussed this. He instructed that
this was to be done.
2) The atmospheric conditions inside the room are in my opinion being exacerbated by the
occupants who are clearly closing the bedroom doors at night and not opening the
windows. This is plainly evident from the high concentrations of mould within the upper
surface of the insulation. This has got substantially worse since my last visit. When this is
compared with the insulation above the rest of the house including the bathroom and
kitchen it can be clearly seen that there is little or no ventilation in these rooms at night.
The cause is therefore occupational moisture created and not managed effectively by the
owners.
I would point out that even though the insulation is to be upgraded at the edge of the room by the
insurers, unless the occupants are prepared to change their lifestyle habit of sleeping in poorly
ventilated rooms, then the problem will not go away, instead it will manifest itself elsewhere at
the coldest part of the structure in that enclosed space with moist atmospheric conditions. This
will give rise to mould whose spores can be toxic to those sensitive to them.",1
0118_CM20.pdf,"We are advised two loads of washing are processed per week and are either dried outside on the
balcony or in the kitchen on a clothes horse. At the time of our visit, clothing was also being dried on the
radiator in the lounge. A number of windows were open at the time of our visit along with trickle vents.
However it was noted that the trickle vent in the kitchen is stuck and needs attention.
No extraction units were noted within the flat.
Very little mould was noted at the time of our visit other than just above the front door and to a section
of ceiling in the bedroom.
The flat being located on the top floor is exposed to high winds and at time of visit, wind was blowing
through into the flat via the letter box and would support heating the property in winter being an issue.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out which indicated the structure to be dry (section ) other than
an area in the bedroom around survey location ‘A’. This section relates to the corner of the balcony and
a possible defect.
Due to the gale force wind at time of the survey, a very limited inspection was made of the upstand at
base level out on the balcony in relation to the problem area in the bedroom. This revealed very slight
cracking to the render finish and could explain the high readings recorded in the bedroom at base level
but, a more detailed inspection is recommended.
As requested, building material samples have been taken from the floor and wall in this location and
tested for the presence of salts and free moisture. Results indicated no significant levels of soluble
chloride or nitrates present in the samples but did contain small levels of free moisture possibly indicting
a source of water ingress.
Based on BS5250:2002 Code of practice for control of condensation in buildings: the occupation would
be graded as a ‘dry’ occupation based on the levels recorded at the time of the survey (Section 5.4).
However it is the opinion of the author the likely cause of the mould noted in the property is being
driven by internal atmospheric conditions and a lack of ventilation. Although located to the top floor,
the lack of forced ventilation to areas of high moisture production i.e. the kitchen and bathroom along
with the drying of clothes within the property will be contributing factors to the conditions pertinent for
the development of mould.
With regards to the corner of the bedroom it is unlikely to be as a direct result of any condensation only
issues but more likely a defect around the base of the balcony.",3
0015_DA12.pdf,"A moisture survey has been undertaken (Section 4.0) in the area of concern to the kitchen with elevated
readings noted however, previous damp remediation works are suggested with elevated readings at
depth (REL(PS)) and moderate to dry surface readings (%WME).
Salts damage was noted to the rear exterior wall, likely to be caused by a power cable set into the
exterior wall disrupting the render system which could be part of the damp remedial works. In general,
the condition of the wall finishes in this area were in good order.
The main concern of the author is ventilation in the property such that elevated atmospheric moisture
levels were indicated sufficient to support mould growth (Sections 4.2 & 5.0).
Observations highlighted issues with the chimney to the righthand flank wall of the property which
needs suggested urgent attention with masonry reported failing from the property (section 6.2).",1
0020_GL10.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised his disability aligns to a fixed seat located in the bathroom for showering
that had suffered a long term leak likely through the fixings. When they inspected the area personally they
advised the interior of the stud wall and associated timbers were rotten and could well align to the length
of time the seat was installed.
At the time of the assessment, the area had been repaired along with localized lower adjoining walls in
the two cupboards. We are again advised that no work was undertaken in the adjoining kitchen.
A moisture assessment through the main areas of concern revealed potential elevated moisture readings
to the tiles that had been replaced and, in order to rule the possibility of any construction elements in the
tile that could be reacting with the electronic moisture meter
such that, in order to rule out possible earlier condensation, drilled readings to a depth of approx. 1” were
undertaken in some locations with persistent high levels still evident (Section 4.0).
An assessment of the external side wall clearly suggests that retrospective cavity wall insulation has been
injected and includes the front and rear wall locations.
In addition, around the perimeter it would appear the render finish has been amended with a repair
segment up to 8 to 10 inches high at the foot that has not as yet been decorated. A visual assessment of
this finish suggested it is wet.
The external wall to the master bedroom and bedroom 2 showed localized salts damage through its
section below the brick to the first floor. Damaged render finishes can readily allow rainwater to penetrate
the finish but, they do not have the ability to evaporate adequately leading to potential issues with the
outer brickwork remaining wet.
With drilled holes on the outside suggesting cavity wall insulation being installed, if the outer leaf
brickwork is indeed wet, it will migrate to the cavity and can lead to wetting of the insulation. Should this
indeed be the case, wet insulation loses its thermal capability leading to the inner leaf walls becoming wet
and indeed cold and could readily align to the elevated readings noted in these areas.
With normal everyday moisture generation, when this comes into contact with the colder external walls,
condensation can occur and can show itself as beads or running moisture.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a structural dampness related issue aligned to the
external elevations with particular emphasis on the side wall.
It is recommended a detailed invasive check if this wall in particular is undertaken to confirm the integrity
of the insulation and the true moisture levels within the cavity due to the poor external finish. If wet
conditions are noted to the insulation, it is recommended the entire external elevation is checked around
the perimeter of this property.
Once this investigation has been completed and any remediations undertaken, it is recommended the
elevations as a whole are repaired and redecorated to uphold a repellent feature for rainwater.",1
0052_ME3.pdf,"Possible ACM’s noted in the property:
 Artex finish to wall structures through a number of areas in the property are affected by the
locations of structural damp.
Moisture related issues through the property:
The moisture survey undertaken (Section 5.0) indicated areas of significant structural moisture to both
ground floor and first floor areas and with regard to first floor, rainwater ingress issues with the exterior
render was suggested (Section 8.3). Moisture levels affecting the ground floor wall structures would
tend to suggest a plumbing issue affecting the structure where a reasonably minor issue was identified
with regard to the bath waste (Section 8.2). It is the opinion of the author however this is not the only
source of moisture affecting the structure and further plumbing checks are recommended.
Atmospheric moisture conditions
With regard to installed forced ventilation, the kitchen extractor is reported not to work and has been
covered with a wall unit during an upgrade of the kitchen units (Section 7.2.1). The bathroom extractor
was shown not to have sufficient overrun to effectively clear internal damp air to the exterior (Section
7.2.2).
Mould activity noted in the property was likely to be driven by raised atmospheric moisture levels from
occupational activity combined with ineffective ventilation, being the significant drivers for the internal

showed all of the flats apart from flat 3 have been affected by the loss. The affected areas include a
section of wall to the communal stairway adjoining the kitchen area to flat 4. Timber decaying fungal
activity was noted to the loss affected bathroom and adjoining kitchen area to flat 5 with observations
suggesting the kitchen area to flat 4 below is also affected (Section 6.1). The basement was accessed and
the structure is damp however this would be expected as observations made would suggest it is not
tanked (Section 6.2) and observations made would suggest the basement area has not been affected by
the loss to a great extent, if at all.",0
0202_PO7.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out through the property with particular attention made to the
reported areas of mould growth. The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated a dry structure.
With regard to the internal atmospheric conditions relative humidity levels were elevated producing
sufficient water activity adjacent to cooler surfaces to sustain mould activity. It was noted the extractor
fan unit in the bathroom has been upgraded and overruns to complete one air change after the
bathroom is exited (Section 6.1.2). It was confirmed by the occupants, that laundry is dried on an airer
and radiator to the hallway in the flat (Section 6.2).
Base on the information gathered and observations made it is the opinion of the author the mould
activity affecting the property is driven by atmospheric moisture levels which in turn are driven by
occupational activity.",3
0291_W11.pdf,"The main areas of concern relate to the rear elevation of two bedroom areas and the moisture survey
(Section 4.0) did highlight raised moisture levels to the base of the wall structures through these areas
with raised capacitance levels indicated up the walls REL(PS). Drilled invasive readings (Section 4.2)
indicated in general the wall structure above 300mm up from the internal floor level at survey location
‘C’ was reasonably dry. With regard to the raised capacitance levels indicated up the wall structures
these could be influenced by condensation wetting the plaster finishes etc. Condensation issues may
well be occurring during colder periods for example during the night. The thermal survey (Section 5.1)
did indicate there was only a 3° difference in the wall temperature and the atmospheric dew point
temperature at survey location ‘C’. It was noted the rear door and window were opened prior to the
survey. An additional area of decorative failure combined with raised moisture levels was indicated in
the bathroom adjacent to the toilet. Raised moisture levels were indicated in relation to the floor in the
bathroom area which would not be unusual and may well be an influence on the levels indicated in the
surveyed wall structure at survey location ‘J’. Due to the indicated age of the property it is not certain
what the DPC provision is at the property (Section 7.2)",1
0271_TA9.pdf,"The moisture survey (section 5.0) indicated elevated readings noted in two locations within the
property. Firstly, around the perimeter of the chimney on the first floor where evidence of water ingress
and high moisture readings were recorded. Remedial works were ongoing and it is believed the chimney
was being removed as part of these roofing works.
Within the bedroom it was noted that an aerial coax cable had been fed into the room through a hole
made in the ceiling, however it was not identified whether the cable enters the property.
Elevated moisture readings were also noted around the area where the toilet soil pipe exits the solid
external wall. No visible leaks were evident with the plumbing and this could partially be down to
condensation occurring at this point of cold bridging. In addition high readings were noted to isolated
areas by the front and rear doors but these do not give rise for any concern however, their review would
be recommended.
It is the opinion of the author the reported areas of elevated readings are as a result of the building
defects already identified being remedied.
The property houses 5 people and 2 dogs which are normally kept indoors. The resultant high internal
atmospheric conditions in combination with the low internal temperatures and occupational activities
are likely to lead to the issues reported within the property. A lack of ventilation and thermal efficiency
of the building occupational levels within the property will add to the issues being experienced. No
mould was observed at the time of the survey.",1
0187_NW8.pdf,"A review of the structure to flat 7 was made with areas of obvious water damage being inspected,
present moisture levels being checked and suggested courses being documented.
A number of areas of historical water ingress and leaks were identified however ongoing areas of water
ingress were noted affecting the exterior wall to the stairway in the property plus the external door to
the lounge area where water ingress is affecting the door reveal.
Observations made in flat 7 identified evidence of a significant historic plumbing leak which in the
opinion of the author was the major source of the moisture which has caused the damage through this
area.",0
0281_TN33.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated in general dry structural moisture levels through the
property in relation to the window reveals etc. observation would suggest condensation on the window
units as opposed to water ingress is the driver for the issues being experienced.
Issues were highlighted with the designed forced ventilation at the property in both the bathroom and
both en-suite areas (Section 6.2).
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) did highlight possible issues of cold bridging in relation to the design of
the window units. Comments made by the tenant indicated the issues being experienced are driven per
low external temperatures.",1
0290_W10.pdf,"The property is in the process of being refurbished and trades were working in the property at the time
of the survey. The kitchen area was stripped and reinstatement works were under way in the bathroom.
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) in general indicated a dry structure however areas of raised structural
moisture were indicated and these have been listed with likely causes detailed (Section 6.2). Further
investigation may well be prudent as detailed.
With regard to the mould activity noted through the property, many areas which displayed significant
mould development in fact displayed a dry structural moisture condition (Section 6.3.2). Extensive
mould was noted affecting the window units to the bedroom areas (Section 6.3.1) and is the opinion of
the author the moulds affecting these areas are likely to be driven by the atmospheric moisture load in
the property combined with cool surface temperatures leading to raised relative humidity levels and
subsequent mould activity.
Observations made with regard to the forced ventilation of the property (Section 6.1.2) suggest the units
are to be upgraded as part of the works being undertaken. The bathroom at the property is internal and
as such will be a major source of atmospheric moisture and therefore effective ventilation is critical.",3
0078_SN8.pdf,"The tenant advises she moved in with her son in the summer of 2016 and immediately redecorated
throughout. Soon after, issues of damp and mould were evident throughout the flat to all rooms and the
tenant repainted on numerous occasions for mould to return shortly after and understand the tenant
and her son are currently receiving medical treatment following reported issues with coughing and
rashes.
A moisture survey of the property was undertaken (section 4.0) which revealed raised readings localized
to low lying wall areas were relating to areas of condensation on the external walls however, in the main
a dry structure was recorded. Location points A & B in bedroom 1 relate to the area where condensation
was seen pouring from the window sill onto the carpet. A thermal survey confirmed ongoing
condensation at the time of the survey (section 5.0).
An element of mould was seen within bedroom 2 just above skirting level to the external wall as well as
on the child’s bed and within the bathroom, mould was noted to the external wall at base level behind
the WC, hand basin, around the extraction unit and to the concrete ceiling with growth also noted to the
uPVC window and blind.
Mould was also evident to furniture and clothing in areas with some items in a cupboard that appears to
be trapping warm moist air in this cooler environment.
With regard to installed ventilation, an extraction unit is present within the bathroom which operates
via a pull cord and delivered an adequate air flow but did not have an overrun after being switched off.
The Kitchen appears to have the door removed to it and the installed extraction unit was not working
with the tenant confirming this hasn’t worked since moving into the property. All trickle vents to the
windows were open at the time of the survey.
We note storage heaters have been installed but are not used by the tenant due to the running costs
and they have purchased electric heaters to use instead.
We are advised when undertaking washing of clothes, the items are placed either in the communal area
to dry or outside in warmer months.
In conclusion it is the opinion of the author condensation was clearly occurring at the time of the survey
with internal atmospheric conditions being the main contributing factor together with a lack of
adequate ventilation. It is advised mould noted to contents items within the property (See section 6.2 &
6.3) is a clear indicator of prevailing elevated atmospheric conditions.
With a non-functioning kitchen extraction unit and the door having been removed, the generated
moisture whilst this area is in use will lead to elevated humidity levels through the property.",3
0296_W6.pdf,"The moisture survey incorporating a variety of survey methods (Section 4.0) indicated in general a dry
structure. It was indicated by the tenant, significant water ingress through the exterior walls was a major
concern. The indicated moisture condition of the external walls did not support the reported
observations.
Failure of the decorative wall finishes and minor mould activity was noted in the lounge area with
additional mould activity noted in other areas through the property (Section 7.2 & 7.5). It is the opinion
of the author the damage to the decorative wall finishes and mould activity is being driven by
condensation and raised relative humidity levels driven by high internal atmospheric levels in
association with cold surfaces.
The thermal survey (Section 5.0) highlighted varying surface temperatures in relation to the external
walls. Checks were made which indicated consistent low moisture conditions across the varying wall
temperatures.
A possible issue was indicated with the control of the extractor unit to the bathroom area (Section
6.2.1). However in general the extractor units servicing the bathroom and kitchen appear to be
adequate.
It was reported by the tenant heat retention in the property is an issue (Section 7.3) and certainly in the
lounge area. Raised internal atmospheric conditions combined with cold surface temperatures are most
likely causes for the issues being reported.",1
0252_TA6.pdf,"A moisture survey was undertaken and elevated readings recorded at points A and B up to
approximately 1m in height along the front elevation may indicate the presence of rising damp. The
external floor height is approximately the same as the internal solid floor to the front of the property
and readings above 1m on the same section of wall are dry which could suggest it is less likely to be
attributed to atmospheric conditions. Such internal atmospheric conditions at the time of the survey
were at acceptable levels for two occupants living at this location and, with the absence of mould, is
more likely to indicate a penetrating condition.
High moisture readings at low level around both chimneys could be expected due to the lack of a DPC
and DPM in these locations during construction. A high reading in the kitchen floor would also be
expected due to the ground floor slab and the vinyl floor covering acting as a potential moisture barrier.
An isolated high reading in the bathroom is not uncommon as it was adjacent from the WC and
localized.
It is the opinion of the author that further checks are made of the front elevation and should include an
assessment of the inner leaf moisture content at depth plus an invasive inspection of the cavity to check
for any issues that may give rise to a penetrating damp issue, i.e. bridging and/or wet insulation (if
fitted).
Where necessary, a gravimetric test of the same structure should be considered to enable affirmation of
the presence of salts and/or free moisture to assist confirming the source of the reported issue.
A check of the removed chimneys below floor level would be beneficial to establish the source of damp
being reported. Where chimneys have previously been removed, an assessment of the hearth is also
required to ensure it does not contribute to ongoing moisture ingress.",1
0069_RG2.pdf,"Consideration was given to the main areas of concern and, the remaining areas were viewed for any possible contributory elements.
A moisture related survey of the affected areas emitted dry readings however, pin readings were high in one location in the bedroom and the corner
of the hallway near the front door. Subsequent drilled readings in these areas indicated a dry condition and therefore, the higher readings could be
due to periods of condensation.
This theory is supported by a lack of trickle vents in the hallway – an area of atmospheric transfer plus, no forced ventilation in the open-plan kitchen
lounge such that, there is a significant reliance on purging (opening windows) to clear generated moist air. In the absence or restriction of this
approach, the generated warm moist air will freely travel through the property and, where cooler surface areas exist, i.e. corners of the structure and
restricted areas behind contents, the potential for condensation remains that will lead to the visual mould.
From a structural perspective, there were no obvious indications of damage that could readily allow rainwater to penetrate the building fabric and find
its way to the inner surface. However, there were areas noted that could be improved (see observations).
In conclusion, it is the opinion of the author, the reported issues are likely due to periods of elevated atmospheric moisture and inadequate
ventilation. The absence of forced ventilation in the open-plan kitchen is a key contributor alongside absent trickle vents to the hallway window. In
addition the noted extraction unit in the bathroom is manually controlled and hence, is reliant on resident use. Guidance is recommended to assist
atmospheric management with the closing of the door and leaving the extractor functioning for 10 – 15 minutes after use to clear the air. However,
for the extractor to be efficient, it is a consideration in Part F of the Building Regs that 10mm door undercuts are maintained to aid make-up air
entering the room and upholding extractor performance. All the doors in the property were tight to the floor finish whereby air circulation is a
recommendation alongside compliant extraction devices in the ‘wet’ rooms i.e. Kitchen and bathroom. To the exterior plant growth is bridging the dpc
and can lead to constant wetting plus, it is restricting the air vents effectivity. It was noted a membrane beneath the earth elements is sloping towards
the building which could result in the same impact. The bathroom extraction is expelled via a passive plate which is not recommended for effective
extraction alongside potential rainwater ingress.

0133_DT4.pdf,"One adult resides at the property and we are advised two washing loads are processed per week which
are always dried within the flat. We are further advised the tenant does not make use of the two
extraction units. Trickle vents are fitted to all windows and were closed the time of the survey, as were
the majority of the windows themselves.
We note a passive vent in bedroom 2 that is clear to the outside.
At the time of our survey there were slight signs of mould only noted at base level to external walls in
bedroom 1 (Survey locations A & B). A moisture survey undertaken indicated the structure to be dry.
On test both forced extraction units in the kitchen and bathroom did not have an overrun and also
emitted flow rates below the recommended level (section 7.1 & 7.2).
In conclusion it is the opinion of the author mould development is likely due to atmospheric conditions
within the flat aligned to occupational activities including drying clothes within the fabric of the building
and a lack of adequate ventilation. Contents placed close to exterior walls are also leading to cold spots
being determined (see section 6.2.1).",3
0276_TN16.pdf,"Building structure:
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated wall structures throughout the property were dry at the
time of the survey, apart from a localized area to the bathroom where high moisture levels are affecting
the lower part wall to the back of the toilet and wash hand basin extending into the internal wall
between the bathroom and the adjoining cupboard. With regard to the floor structures which are
finished with vinyl flooring throughout, high non-invasive readings were recorded through the vinyl
flooring throughout the property (Section 4.2). The high moisture levels indicated to the bathroom and
floor structure could possibly indicate a water leak. Further investigation to clearly understand the
potential issue or issues is recommended.
Internal atmospheric conditions:
Both forced and passive ventilation are installed at the property. With regard to the forced ventilation to
the bathroom readings recorded would suggest the ceiling mounted unit would be effective in removing
damp air from the bathroom to the exterior. The cooker hood to the kitchen area is functioning and
recorded an air speed of 0.9 m/sec.
Mould activity:
Reported areas of mould activity i.e. the internal wall between the bathroom and kitchen and kitchen
units themselves displayed dry readings at the time of the survey. Pictures provided by the tenant
showed contents affected by mould activity (Section 7.1.3). Mould affecting contents would suggest
raised atmospheric moisture levels. Atmospheric moisture levels are in general driven by occupational
activity.",3
0199_PO22.pdf,"A number of issues as previously mentioned are present causing an escape of water, leading to excess
moisture levels throughout the building.
These include:
2 leaks from cistern supply connections
1 Leaking rodding point
1 Leaking waste from the gents toilet.
1 Partially collapsed drain noted in section 5.9
The boundary meter is also registering consumption when all the internal stopcocks are closed. This
could mean that a mains leak is also present.",0
0071_RG31.pdf,"Upon arrival the occupants advised areas of concern mainly
to the upper wall and ceiling junctions to areas in all three
bedrooms and a localized area to the rear wall in the
lounge. In addition, an area close to the front door was also
viewed and, with no obvious defects observed, it is likely this area will be due to condensation as it is an
elevation not benefitting from warm sunshine and is close to the front door where colder air is brought in
that will meet with the warmer internal air leading to areas of condensation where air circulation is
restricted.
A moisture assessment in areas of concern revealed dry conditions apart from the right-hand window
reveal in the main front bedroom which was also noted to be ‘hollow’ in sound suggesting a likely
disconnect with the window and wall junction. In this instance, it is recommended the reveal and window
construction is checked for its structural integrity prior to next winter to uphold a dry internal condition.
With all mould areas suggesting dry conditions, a thermal assessment confirmed the patterns of mould
aligning to colder structural areas and, a review of the loft insulation confirmed gaps where the
wall/ceiling junctions are to the eaves.
Regarding adequate forced ventilation, there is no extractor installed in the kitchen and, the new
bathroom extractor was yet to be configured to extract to the exterior. Both of these elements being ‘wet’
rooms where moisture is mainly generated, in the absence of extraction serve to uphold this warm moist
air circulating the dwelling due to vapour pressure differences and, whilst the property as a whole is in
very good condition, where temperature differences are noted to the structural surfaces, when the warm
air comes into contact with it, at certain times of the day, the dew point temperature will be met leading
to beads of condensation which are a key nutrient for mould.
From a passive ventilation aspect, some trickle vents were open and some closed. These can provide
background ventilation and reduce overnight condensation where comfortable to be utilized.
Of note, mould spores are in the air all the time and, with no forced extraction will freely circulate the
property alongside the vapour pressure transition aided also by the kitchen door being removed. Whilst
this fully understandable, it simply adds a greater emphasis on ensuring the internal air is changed with
dryer external air where possible to break the internal atmospheric trend condition and reduce the
potential for mould to develop.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a requirement to consider completing the bathroom
extractor installation and also consider utilizing a similar device in the kitchen because without a door
fitted, an open window will not extract warm moist air but moreover, will simply remain stable unless
there is a cross-flow of air from another open source.",3
0198_PO22.pdf,"At the time of survey there were no utilities at the property as the occupant has not lived there for
almost 12 months. Therefore, the extractor in the bathroom was noted however it could not be tested
without an electrical supply. There was no extraction in the kitchen.
A moisture survey of the property (section 5.0) showed no elevated readings and most areas did not
record any viable readings due to their low moisture content and, no visible signs of mould were
observed. Atmospheric readings also did not indicate condensation forming as did thermal images taken
at the time of the survey.
It was noted the occupant actively dries washing on radiators in the flat rather than external rotary
dryers to the rear of the building and, although the occupant does not reside at the property, the
volume of possessions and furniture still present would restrict natural air movement contributing to
the build-up of cold areas and resultant condensation at times of occupancy.
All windows had sufficient trickle ventilation and locking handles, enabling the windows to be on night
vents but were all closed at the time of survey.
It is the authors opinion the symptoms described by the occupant would be indicative of raised
atmospheric moisture within the property through occupational activity rather than a structural defect
and is likely contributed to by a lack of adequate ventilation and the addition of elevated moisture when
clothes are dried within the property. The indication of mould on contents items is a clear indication of
periods of elevated internal atmospheric conditions within the property.",3
0176_N1.pdf,"There are a number of areas where water staining to the ceilings was noted through the apartment and
the associated communal area. These areas were opened to allow a clear understanding of the structure
and moisture conditions (Section 4.1) and wall areas displayed wet conditions with dripping water noted
at the survey point to the bathroom ceiling and the survey point to the communal area.
The survey highlighted certainly there may be two distinct areas of water ingress affecting the flat roof
structure and associated ceilings below. The junction between the flat roof structure and the steel
pitched roof over the kitchen and bedroom area (Section 7.1) plus, may be the exterior wall structure
associated with the upper floors which runs above the internal flank wall to the property above the
bathroom, hallway and associated communal area (Section 7.2).
Condensation was not an issue at the time of the survey (Section 5.1) however it is the opinion of the
author it would be a significant issue during the colder periods of the year. The survey highlighted issues
with the forced ventilation of the bathroom area (Section 6.1).
With regard to the flat roof, the survey highlighted a number of areas where the structure below the
membrane has started to fail becoming spongy and is highly likely this is being caused by the ongoing
water ingress.",0
0018_EC1M.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised her concerns regarding
the potential for airborne spores affecting family members and had recently undertaken air spore counts
via another company stating up to 2000 spores had been detected in her daughters bedroom
consequently leading to it not being used and the bathroom and installed vent measures taped over.
The occupant is convinced there is mould affecting her daughters health but cannot detect it. There was
no visible mould anywhere in the property and the only other area of concern was a raised floor element
close to bedroom 3 (see Property Profile) that was dry at the time.
A moisture assessment was only conducted in areas of concern to the occupant aligned to their thoughts
believing there were leaks to shower trays and the doorway leading into bedroom 3.
All readings taken did not suggest any cause for concern with regard to the levels recorded in and
alongside the defined locations suffice to add, there were no singularly increased areas.
Regarding ventilation aspects in the dwelling, it was noted the property has an MVHR system installed in
the open-plan utility area off the hallway and was operational at the time of the survey. Above each wet
room shower, an extractor was noted with air flow readings recorded from each device. Plus, in the open-
plan kitchen/lounge there is a cooker-hood installed that is anticipated to be ducted to the exterior in
accordance with the supplied ventilation plan below. There were no trickle vents to any windows.
In the Master Bedroom, Bedroom 3 and the lounge, linear diffuser outlets are noted installed close to the
ceilings however, only the lounge ducting was open with both bedroom areas taped over in the belief the
system is integrated with all rooms and would therefore deliver any airborne mould spores through the
property as a whole.
Taping these diffusers will likely serve to unbalance the extract and inputting of fresh air as designed by
the MVHR device",3
0192_PO11#.pdf,"At time of visiting flat had been vacated the previous day, 22nd April 2015. Our client was in the process
of preparing the property for viewings and painting a number of walls.
It is advised that the previous tenant stored a large quantity of boxes and contents hard up against
walls. Furthermore it is understood from our client that the previous tenant dried clothing on heaters
without opening windows.
A detailed moisture survey carried out confirms the structure to be dry (see section 4.0).
Based upon information supplied by the client and moisture readings of the structure it is likely that the
reported issues of mould within the flat suggests a life style issue and a lack of ventilation.",3
0086_SS12.pdf,"The tenants have resided in the property for 3 years and, at
the time of the survey all windows were noted to have
trickle vents with all shut at the time.
The wardrobe area was originally part of the bedroom however an internal stud wall has been fitted to
create the wardrobe location. This area has a much cooler temperature and will likely reach dew point
overnight on certain surfaces with evidence of mould also noted in this area.
The wall behind the sofa in the living room has elevated/maximum surface moisture readings to just over
1m high with no readily apparent reason hence, an invasive investigation may be required to determine
the likely cause for the elevated readings.
Cladding on the outside of the property may be having an adverse effect on the inside whereby there is a
difference in temperature on the ground floor compared to the 1st floor.
A moisture survey did not suggest any areas of damp hence, was a dry structure.
There are situations which are not helping achieve adequate ventilation in the property which would relate
to the reported condensation including:
 House temperature is set to 15oC and, when the downstairs is warmer the upstairs remains cooler
 Extractor in kitchen is not working efficiently and, there is no extraction in laundry room
 Downstairs bathroom fan is not working
 Upstairs bathroom fan is operating and relies on manual operation
 Windows being opened and fan switched on at the same time serves to draw air in from the
outside rather than the room as a whole
 Bathroom doors are close to the floor finish whereby Part F of the Building Regs recommends a
10mmm gap between the door underside and the floor finish in order ‘make-up’ air can be drawn
in by an operating extractor to gather and expel the generated moist air
 Insulation in the loft space appears sporadic and ineffective in areas with notable cold spots
throughout during the thermal survey that can lead to areas of condensation",3
0285_TN38.pdf,"The moisture survey undertaken through the surveyed locations (Section 5.0) indicated a dry condition
with regard to the first floor including the areas of significant mould activity associated with the sections
of inclined ceiling. With regard to the ground floor areas, raised moisture levels were indicated with
regard to the exterior walls and readings recorded in the party wall to the adjoining property indicated a
dry condition. With regard to the areas of damp noted to the ground floor external walls, further
invasive investigation is recommended.
Observations made would suggest retrofit polystyrene ball insulation has been installed in the cavity to
the exterior wall (Section 8.1). A slate DPC was noted two courses of brickwork below the internal
finished floor level (Section 8.2).
The thermal survey undertaken showed condensation was not an issue at the time of the survey which
is not unexpected considering the external air temperatures. The thermal survey did however highlight
possible issues with the provision and/or effectiveness of installed insulation to the inclined ceiling
sections through the first floor (Section 6.3). These are the main areas of concern with regard to mould
activity affecting the first floor and is highly likely the design and detailing of the inclined ceiling and
associated insulation is consistent through the adjoining property and other properties in the estate.
A review of the ventilation through the property suggested issues with the passive ventilation certainly
through the first floor areas (Section 7.1.1) whereby a lack of ventilation driving increased internal
humidity levels combined with cool surfaces will be a driver for mould activity. The recorded
atmospheric moisture levels through the property (Section 5.3) also highlighted raised levels to the first
floor.
With regard to the floor structures through the property a mix of ground supported concrete floor slabs
and timber suspended floors were indicated. Resistance readings taken from the timber flooring
indicated a dry structure in general however, raised levels were indicated adjacent to the front door and
the shower to the bathroom. With regard to the ground supported concrete floor slab to the kitchen,
the readings were indicative of a slab pre-dating 1965 where the floor finishes are acting as the DPM to
the slab construction (Section 2.1).
Based on the observations made it is the initial opinion of the author the mould activity affecting the
structure and contents is driven primarily by persistent high internal atmospheric moisture levels, which
are in turn, driven by occupational activity and issues with the ventilation of the structure. This is
certainly the case through the first floor areas.",1
0012_CR8.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident confirmed her personal health concerns and provided a number of photographic
images relating to past experiences of mould. The main area of concern relates to the bedroom in the
middle of the image as viewed from the front of the property with areas of the outer wall plus the wall
adjoining the communal hallway clearly displaying the reported mould (section 6.1).
A moisture related assessment of the structure confirmed areas of elevated readings and, supporting
checks of the floor and lower wall confirmed a likely structural dampness issue (section 4.0).
Upon pulling the carpet back in the affected corner of bedroom 2, the carpet, underlay and gripper rods
were found to be damp to the touch with associated elevated moisture meter levels recorded. The backing
had come away from the main carpet fabric due to the damp and, an invasive drilled reading of the lower
wall confirmed dampness at depth ruling out surface condensation as a likely cause (section 6.1.1.1).
In addition, it was noted there was a thermoplastic floor covering which would likely be acting as a damp
proof membrane for ground moisture aligned to its construction period. However, there were areas
where the thermoplastic tiles were not evident close to the external walls and could most likely align to
the localized areas of dampness recorded in the skirtings and lower wall areas around the perimeter of
the structure where there was no membrane (section 6.1.1).
The skirtings were also very close to the floor finish and could be susceptible to a bridging issue for ground
moisture in the absence of an entire membrane being installed across the entire floor.
Plus, in these areas is where mould was a previous concern and could well align with the exceptional
cooling of the structures due to the dampness such that, during colder periods of the year and the room
in use, significant condensation would have been noted to the windows but would have contributed to
the onset of mould in areas of reduced air movement i.e. behind the wardrobes etc as per the supplied
images.
In the open-plan kitchen, the floor level between the lounge area and the kitchen differs and is likely due
to the installed timber floor finish having been laid however, the appearance of the thermoplastic
membrane was not confirmed in the kitchen with the vinyl floor finish extending under the newly installed
suite.
There remained however, elevated levels of structural moisture in areas and, the full presence of the
membrane could not be confirmed in this entire area without lifting the floor finish. The elevated readings
could well relate to a repeat issue regarding the membrane and is recommended this is confirmed
alongside whether the installed skirtings are in touch with the floor base leading to a bridging issue for
dampness that would align to the elevated readings recorded in these finishes.
Of note, the timber floor finish did not extend to the entire dining floor area with a gap noted under the
radiator cover (section 6.3).
An assessment of the installed ventilation measures confirmed the presence of background trickle vents
to the windows with all open apart from the kitchen unit with it advised as being broken.
Forced extraction devices are installed in the enclosed bathroom and the kitchen with the resident
confirming they are constant running (also confirmed by the surveyor) with a % Relative Humidity (%RH)
controlled boost function in each. Pull cord boosts were also noted that would require manual
intervention for optimum usage. Suffice to add, it is recommended the %RH setting of the kitchen unit is
determined and likely reduced to uphold its non-manual use because it is installed in an open-plan
environment and therefore is unlikely to operate as frequently as the bathroom unit as this is an internal
smaller confined room and will meet the set %RH.
The flow rates recorded were deemed adequate for the rooms they are installed in such that, with a tweak
to the kitchen device, the automatic operation of the extractors would be sufficient for the dwelling.
It was noted the cavity has undergone retrofit insulation measures with the installation of polystyrene
balls that can also act as a bridge for moisture due to their ability to enter the cavity as a whole down to
and past the membranes potentially adding to the reported issues.
A review of the exterior revealed localized bridging by plants and foliage in areas and, their clearance
would also aid securing the health of the structure. Plus, there is a raised garden level across the entire
length of the rear structure and was advised that during significant rainfall has led to pooling water against
the building possibly due to a lack of adequate drainage.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author there is a structural dampness related issue aligned to the
thermoplastic membrane in the property installed as a vapour barrier to ground moisture supported by
visual evidence, delaminated damp carpet backing and rotten gripper rods and, could likely be attributing
to dampness recorded in skirtings and the walls at low level.
Ahead of the upcoming winter and colder periods, the structure requires a detailed overview to rule out
its potential as a contributory factor.
In addition, discussions were undertaken with the resident regarding optimizing the use of the installed
ventilation measures plus the impacts of drying clothes internally and having furniture placed close to

Scope
Following instruction from ………………….., attend the above property to detail current moisture
conditions, identify the extent of the reported moisture affected area and make recommendation
regarding restorative works.
Report
1.0 Property:
The property is a two-bedroom ground floor flat within a
purpose-built block of cavity brick construction and
internal blockwork walls. A timber floor structure was
noted through the property and bears onto a lower
ground supported concrete slab with the floor structure
possibly incorporating thermal insulation. The ceilings are
concrete to the underside floor slab to the flat above.
2.0 Incident
The tenant has reported damp and associated mould
affecting the structure.
3.0 Conclusion – 1st November 2021:
The time for the survey was limited due to the tenant having to leave to collect her children and, offered
to allow the surveyor to remain in the property and let themselves out once the survey was completed.
This offer was declined.
Two areas of concern were highlighted be the tenant, namely the area to the hallway where the
wallpaper has become detached with mould development an issue and, an area to the left-hand side of
the bed in bedroom two.
A detailed moisture survey was carried out in the areas of concern and regarding the hallway and
adjoining bathroom, significant moisture levels were indicated affecting wall structure plus off-scale
readings to the bathroom floor and adjoining areas of the laminate flooring in the hallway. The noted
levels of moisture and spread would tend to suggest a plumbing issue affecting the structure. In
addition, elevated readings were noted to the ceiling possibly pointing to an additional issue in the
property above.
Regarding Bedroom 2, localised elevated readings were noted at survey location ‘O’ involving resistance
readings to the skirting and adjacent wall plaster. This area was covered with a pile of clothing and
uncovered by the tenant to highlight the issue such that it could possibly be condensation driven.
Further investigation would be required to conclusively determine the cause.
3.1 Conclusion – 13th January 2022:
Additional structural moisture readings were recorded which further indicated the main area of concern
is as highlighted on the floor plan.
Survey location ‘O’ to the master bedroom was revisited and highlighted significantly reduced levels,
suggesting as originally thought, the moisture in this area was driven by condensation.
Checks were made in regard to the installed ventilation in the kitchen and bathroom (Section 7.1) issues
were highlighted to the operation of the units plus the recorded flow rate of the bathroom unit. Ideally
the noted issues should be addressed to allow the tenant to better control the internal atmospheric
conditions.
4.0 Recommendations:
Initial visit:
With regard to the hallway/bathroom, a leak detection survey should be carried out to clearly determine
the source of loss moisture. Once remediated, enabling works, restorative drying followed by
reinstatement will be required.
Return visit:
 In the opinion of the author, providing effective forced ventilation to the kitchen and bathroom
areas is essential and, installed continuous running units with a humidity-controlled boost
correctly sized will, in conjunction with the natural permeability of the structure, provide
continuous background ventilation to the dwelling. When fan units are specified and installed
follow-up flow rate checks should always be carried out to ensure the units are compliant and
meet the designed specification.
The continuous combined flow rate of both units ideally should meet the calculated ‘Whole
dwelling ventilation rate’ which for this property is 19.1 Litres/Sec.
 Check the undercuts to the internal doors (Section 7.1.4) and remediate as required.

6.0 Thermal survey:
6.1 Bedroom 2:
The coldest surface temperature in the area was 14.2oC
this being the area of concern which was covered with
clothing.
Based on a suggested room temperature of 20oC, if the
relative humidity in the room was above 70%RH,
condensation would be an issue.
It may well be the case condensation had occurred earlier
in the day with conditions persisting under the clothing.
7.0 Observations and relevant information:
7.1 Ventilation – 13th January 2022:
7.1.1 Forced ventilation – Bathroom:
Pictured is the wall mounted extractor to the bathroom,
manually operated via a pull cord, and as such is reliant on
the tenant for its correct operation.
Standard:
Air speed: 2.0 m/sec.
7.1.2 Effective ventilation of the property:
If a bathroom extractor is installed adjacent to a window, having the window open will allow make-up
air to be drawn in from the exterior rather than from the rest of the property. This will reduce the
effectiveness of the fan unit in regard to controlling humidity levels in the bathroom and the wider
property.
7.1.3 Kitchen extractor:
Pictured is the wall mounted extractor to the kitchen and
was switched off at the isolator. The unit is continuous
running with a boost function likely to be humidity
controlled and via a pull cord.
Standard:
Air speed: 0.8 m/sec.
Boost:
Air speed: 5.4 m/sec.
7.1.4 Make-up air flow into bathroom:
To ensure extractor fan units are effective, make-up air must be able to flow freely into the ventilated
areas. Plus, undercuts to all the doors through the property are required to allow the free flow of
background ventilation. To this end Part F of the Building Regulations requires a gap of 10mm.
7.1.5 Fan flow rate requirements:
In regard to the forced ventilation in the bathroom, it was noted an intermittent functioning fan unit is
installed.
Building regulations indicate the following flow rates are required in relation to bathroom and kitchen
fan operating intermittently:
Bathroom 15 Litres/second
Kitchen 30 Litres/second adjacent to the hob.
60 Litres/Second elsewhere
In regard to the forced ventilation in the kitchen, a continuous running unit with a boost function when
elevated humidity levels are detected was noted.
Building regulations indicate the following flow rates are required in relation to the boost function:
Bathroom 8 Litres/second
Kitchen 13 Litres/second
In addition to ventilating the kitchen and bathroom there is also a requirement to achieve the ‘Whole
dwelling ventilation rate’. Which in regard to the surveyed is 19.1 Litres/Sec.
7.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
Protimeter Surveymaster on search mode using radio frequency survey method with readings given
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. Survey depth is approximately 5 to 15 mm depending on material
characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore they
should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
Tramex MRH using electrical impedance survey method on non-wood materials the readings are given
numerically from 0 to 99. Please note the readings are subjective and open for interpretation, therefore
they should not be used indicate actual moisture content. Readings taken from wood are given as a
%mc the unit can be calibrated to wood species the readings indicated can be taken as an indication of
wood moisture content. Survey depth up to 30 mm depending on material characteristics
Invasive moisture readings have been taken using a Protimeter Surveymaster reading direct % moisture
in wood and % wood moisture equivalent (%WME) in other materials.
Air moisture readings have been obtained using a Tramex MRH and a Protimeter Hygromaster
measuring temperature in °C, % relative humidity and specific moisture content in g/Kg
information to gauge the true condition. However, for the purposes of this report the following readings
can be taken as an indication that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory
level.

0178_N16.pdf,"On arrival the occupants indicated that over a period of time they had suffered rain water ingress
through the bottom of the patio doors within the lounge and bedroom to the rear of the property.
However in January of this year silicone sealant to the exterior of these affected doors had been
replaced with new and subsequently the water ingress had stopped. During our survey all areas
reported to have been affected were found to be within acceptable moisture tolerances and were
deemed to be dry (Section 4.0 – 4.3).
A full moisture survey was carried out recording moisture levels and atmospheric conditions within each
room and recorded accordingly. During our survey it was bought to our attention excessive mould
contamination to the plaster skim walls within the confines of the kitchen base units at low level. An
effective remediation is recommended to alleviate the condition and prevent cross-contamination.
It was advised that during October 2014 through to January 2015 there was a leak behind the kitchen
units and that no mould remediation was carried out. It is believed this mould contamination is a by-
product of the water damage and that full mould remediation is required to rectify the outbreak.
With regard to condensation trickle vents were noted as open at the time of the survey however an
assessment of the forced vent units in the kitchen and bathroom indicated the open-plan kitchen unit
recorded a flow rate of approx. 2 l/s and the bathroom was measured at 3.1 l/sec with no overruns on
either unit. Both could be regarded as not meeting current building regulations for their respective
locations and likely be the cause of reported condensation after using the areas.",1
0116_CM12.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated significant moisture levels in the chipboard flooring through
the two bedroom areas and the en-suite to the master bedroom. Mould activity is affecting the floor
structure throughout the property to varying levels according to the distance from the indicated loss
area. The underlay to the carpet was found to be acting as a membrane (Section 5.4) trapping loss
moisture in the form of moisture vapour supporting the mould activity.
The owner has lived at the property for approximately 5 years - the issues being investigated are
reported to have developed over the last year.
A number of issues were highlighted which would have supplied loss water to the floor construction:
 A leak was identified with regard to the shower cubical to the master bedroom en-suite
(Section 5.2). It was confirmed the shower was used on a daily basis.
 It was reported by the owner of the property the heating system is currently losing pressure
requiring to be regularly topped up (Section 5.1).
Considering the nature of the mould activity, plus the pattern of the indicated loss moisture in the
structure combined with the indicated leaks identified during the survey, it is the opinion of the author
the loss moisture relates to internal plumbing issues etc. rather than a water ingress into the structure
from the exterior.",0
0268_TA9.pdf,"The reported mould was not evident to the walls, having been painted in selected areas throughout and
assumed to align with where the mould once was (Section 6.1), though there was some mould still
evident to the frames of the UPVC windows. As mould has been present throughout the property, it will
reoccur if not remediated effectively with a fungicidal treatment to eradicate the root system prior to
any redecoration.
The moisture survey (Section 4.2) indicated in general the wall structures to the first floor displayed dry
readings. However, the survey of the ground floor indicated a consistent level of high moisture readings
to the skirting, with notable high readings to the base of the walls in the kitchen and part of the living
room. Invasive drilled readings recorded at depth into the wall structure in these locations supported
the readings taken (Section 4.4).
The record of consistent high readings to the skirting almost throughout the ground floor suggests a
strong likelihood the DPC to the inner wall could be bridged by the sand and cement screed laid over the
concrete sub-floor. The screed has the thermoplastic tiles installed as the DPM on top of it. Without the
separation of the screed from the DPC, dry skirting then laid directly on to it is likely to wick moisture up
from below the DPC. Confirmation of this likely structural causation for high moisture readings in this
property can only be undertaken by an invasive inspection.
Aside from the proposed structural causes contributing to moisture in the property, other factors may
exacerbate conditions for high levels of mould growth. The property does not benefit from forced air
extraction at all (bathroom or kitchen).
At survey location D where the cooker would be situated (Section 6.3) there is the solid wall aligned to
the alley. Similarly, location C is where a washing machine or dishwasher may be situated. This wall is
likely to suffer from being persistently cold and without the assistance of forced fan ventilation is a
probable site for condensation to occur.
Location G in the kitchen aligns with location X in the living room. This wall forms one side of the
chimney breast. Moisture penetration through the chimney pot was considered and an external
examination of the chimney pots suggests these are not capped or hatted (Section 6.4); however on
review this thought unlikely, though it is suggested covering the pot would be prudent.
An examination of the chimney breast in the loft space suggests previous moisture ingress at the roof-
chimney connection (Section 6.5) having affected the wooden roof structure. The roof structure
requires further inspection to confirm its integrity.
The render and floor in the area of the front door are in a poor state of repair (Section 6.6), requiring
attention. The external DPC was noted to be below the front step level (Section 6.7) and though some
structural movement is evident, its integrity appears to be intact.
In the living room under the window there is a sill-to-floor crack that aligns with indicated elevated
readings at location S. An examination of the tiled external sill shows this to be broken in several places
(Section 6.8) and to have had previous repairs. This could be a source for moisture ingress at this point.
An inconsistent reading was taken upstairs in the cupboard of bedroom 2 at location J1. This unusual
record may be a false reading, though further investigation and monitoring may be required.",1

Scope
Following instruction from………………….., we have been asked to investigate damp and mould issues in
the above property following works carried out by another contractor.
Report
1.0 Property:
An extensively developed property dedicated to the care of elderly residents. The home comprises a
number of buildings that have been extensively developed and added to over the year, probably as the
business has developed and with the need for additional space. Construction appears to be a mixture of
traditional cavity wall masonry although some areas might have timber elements. The whole
development has been roofed with a Redland Stonewold concrete tile. External walls are all rendered
with sand and cement and painted with white exterior emulsion.
2.0 Incident:
I have been supplied with and refer below in my investigations and conclusions to the following reports
and schedules supplied to me by our instructing client Lancer Scott.
Technical Report by Stephen Bryant of Crawford’s dated 7th May 2015.
Site Investigation-Drainage report by CET Property Assurance dated 1st February 2016
Schedule of works prepared by the original contractor (unknown) who carried out the repair work.
The information contained in the above reports and schedules indicates that the discovery of internal
and external cracking that appeared in the property was made by the onsite maintenance department.
They subsequently carried out repairs as part of routine maintenance, however the cracking reappeared
and the maintenance department installed an Acrylic Graphical overlapping crack monitoring slide. This
revealed movement in the wall of approximately 1 mm in 12 months, which along with other cracking of
widths 1-3 mm in various areas was diagnosed as subsidence movement with structural damage in
category 2 (slight) as defined in BRE Digest 251. All as reported in the Crawford Specialist Property
Services Subsidence Technical report of the 7th May 2015.
A contactor was appointed from the Crawford’s Network (Unknown) and a schedule of works Reference
No: RN035384-SBC2 was prepared by them. This appears to be dated 24th September 2015 and I assume
that repair work would have commenced shortly afterwards.
The onsite maintenance manager advised that he had little to do with the repair works that so far as he
was concerned went smoothly. However, during this recent wet winter weather damp appeared on the
internal wall of the staircase that serves the ground floor laundry area located in the front right hand
building in the picture above. This damp was always worse a day or so after the wet period. Following
the report of damp problems occurring in the structure Crawford’s appointed CET to carry out an
inspection of the drains around the damp area. This report did not pick up any defects in the drains. The
report appears to have been limited in scope to the actual pipework serving the drains and does not
cover the condition of the gullies. The actual pipework inspected is shown on the plan below which is
extracted from sheet 1 of 1 of the CET report dated 1st February 2016.
The damp area internally that is shown in the following picture is located in the inside staircase wall
opposite the rain water gulley designated as RWG2 in the CET drainage layout plan below pictured next
to it.
3.0 Investigations, findings and conclusions.
This revealed that the damp problem (shown in picture at 2.0 above) is centred upon the external
rainwater back inlet gulley RWG2 located on the upper terrace area. This is adjoining the outside wall,
adjacent to the retaining wall above the lower steps and constructed against the structure designated
MAIN BUILDING X3 in the plan extract above.
A close examination of the back inlet gulley revealed two defects. The first is that the downpipe from
the guttering does not discharge in the recommended position into the back inlet gulley. The correct
way for discharging into this type of gulley is squarely onto the rear half of the gulley and below the top
of the gulley to prevent any spillage. Good practice would also involve a sealed back plate (see typical
schematic of a Back Inlet Gulley). The picture below shows that the discharge from this downpipe would
result in spillage outside the gulley
A close up picture of the gulley shows that at some time in the past the downpipe might have been
connected into the rear entry half of the BIG (see above right), but either an offset connector has been
removed or there has been some ground displacement resulting in the downpipe no longer being
positioned directly above and into the gulley. From the way the gulley is recessed into the surrounding
area subsidence of the ground in this area is likely.
There is a crack around the edge of the gulley which would result in large volumes of water entering the
ground rather than discharging into the private sewer. Further evidence of this is displayed in the green
organic growth around back of the gulley and in the open joints. In my view 50% of the water coming
down the downpipe could potentially enter the ground and this could be part of the cause for softening
in the immediate vicinity. The contractors schedule refers to works to be carried out to rainwater goods.
Below I refer to an area externally that has a crack in it and possible re-rendering. This being the case, I
would have assumed that this downpipe would have been removed and then repositioned, but it
appears that this is original.
Internally on the other side of the wall there is a damp patch shown in the first picture above left. I have
included below a schematic view of the internal stair wall showing the relevant structural features in
relation to ground level, the downpipe, cavity fill and where the structural crack was located.
I examined inside the cavity wall using a Boroscope through a hole drilled from the inside. This was
located adjacent to where the gulley is positioned externally and showed that water is getting through
the outer skin of blockwork on top of what appears to be the solid wall below ground level adjacent to
the stair string. It is also possible that this is cavity fill or mortar droppings on top of the solid wall. The
wall below ground is solid masonry and suggestive of a retaining wall The internal wall below DPC level
abutting the point of ingress is saturated with water. It has very high WME readings and very high REL
readings which are at maximum (See table below at 7.0).
There is a very large visible area of damp as shown in my pictures, but is only approximately 25% to 30%
of the actual area which is damp within the matrix and having very high REL readings. The extent of
damp is shown in the schematic above and is edged in a dotted blue line which is diagonal from the stair
string and then runs to the left hand side of a vertical strip of raised plaster suggestive of a repaired
area. Further investigation would be required to determine why the damp should stop at this point but
it does suggest that this is due to moisture rising up in the blockwork by capillary action i.e. rising damp.
Again the location of this suggest that the gulley/downpipe externally is the source of this moisture.
The render tanking to this internal below ground wall has failed and in the area shaded blue above, this
has detached from the background. I am unable to say with any degree of certainty if the detaching of
this render tanking is caused directly by the resultant movement/settlement of the building or from
another cause. There is no indication on the schedule of works that work to this area has been carried
out. However, the rendering has detached from the wall behind. It is therefore my opinion that the most
likely cause for such detachment could be from when the wall was cut back to carry out crack repairs. If
not from excessive vibration when hacking off it could be the result of poor workmanship when
reinstating this area. Either way further investigation would be required to determine this.
The schedule of works item 3 refers to 8.00 linear metres of plaster repair with EML, cut back 75 mm
either side of the structural crack. The crack shown in the pictures on the Crawford’s report dated 7th
May 2015 shows that the vertical line of cracking runs down the edge of where I believe a structural
steel support is in the wall and joins a dry lined area referred to below. My reason for this assumption is
that two holes drilled into the wall with a 12 mm masonry bit hit a solid point at about 30 mm into the
wall which resembled hitting heavy gauge steel. I was also unable to identify a crack repair at this point
as described.
I found an area of wall approximately 650 mm wide and full height from mid landing to ceiling to the left
of the very wet area shown in my schematic. The Crawford’s report shows a picture in this area (see
page 8 top left) with a crack running vertically up from the mid landing and then going diagonally across
the wall. This is now dry lined with plasterboard but there is no mention of this in the schedule of
works. I was therefore unable to properly identify what this is covering or the purpose of the dry lining
and its change from one construction finish to another.
Externally the Crawford’s surveyors report pictures shows a vertical crack exactly in line with the internal
crack. The contractors schedule refers to 5.5 square metres of rendering on metal lathing, which I have
assumed is in the area of the external cracking as shown in the surveyor’s report. However, I could not
see the evidence for his area of wall having been re-rendered and as mentioned above that the
downpipe had been removed. Rather it is likely, but not certain without further investigation that only a
small area has been rendered and surface crack filling might have been carried out. If this is the case it
could have left a water pathway through the external wall, particularly at or below the higher ground
level where the retaining wall joins the staircase outer wall.
I examined the roof junction above the area where it appears a steel column support is inside the wall
(see schematic above). I found that there was possible point of ingress of water at the verge tile and
soaker where the flashing had pulled out of the wall. This not shown on the schedule of works and is
therefore either a long standing defect or as a result of the disruption caused by the differential
settlement between the higher level/earlier building and the newer extension protruding to the front.
Whilst it is relatively minor defect this should be repaired so as to eliminate any other points of ingress
of water into the structure.
5.0 Recommendations:
5.1Carry out further investigation to establish if the works carried out where in accordance
with the requirements of the Crawford’s surveyors report and in accordance with the
schedule.
5.2Immediately have the external downpipe repositioned and lengthened in order that it can
be directed in the Back Inlet Gulley.
5.3Investigated the back inlet gulley to make sure that it is seated on firm ground and not
vulnerable to undermining from water as this might cause problems in the future.
5.4Clear out any bridging to the cavity where it is built off the solid wall and slope top to fall
outwards and away from internal structure elements.
5.5Investigate why the dry lining has been fitted onto the wall at the base of the stairs. Was
this original?
5.6Carry out invasive testing to determine if the cracking internally and externally has been
properly filled in accordance with good practice for structural crack repairs. These should
be filled in such a manner as to prevent a pathway for water from outside the structure to
inside or by bridging the cavity at any point.
5.7Carry out invasive investigations to see if at any point the cracking witnessed inside and
outside passed directly through a solid wall. If this is the case, check to see that cracking
has been fully filled with either a non-shrinking waterproof grout or suitable resin fill.
5.8Carry out invasive investigations to determine the cause for the rendering/tanking to
detach from the background masonry as shown on the schematic and referred to in the
report on investigations, findings and conclusions above.

8.0 Survey Equipment:
Non-destructive moisture readings using:
A Protimeter Aquant BLD5760 moisture detector, using radio frequency survey method, giving readings
numerically from 0 to 999 REL. This gives readings for moisture in materials up to a depth of 19 mm
depending on material characteristics. Please note the readings are subjective and open for
interpretation, therefore they should not be used indicate actual moisture content.
A Protimeter Mini BLD2000 using electrical impedance survey method on wood and other non-
conductive materials. On wood it measures moisture content from 6% to 28%, the level at which the
fibres are saturated. In other non-conductive materials the instrument measures the WME (Wood
Moisture Equivalent) up to 28%.
The WME value is a theoretical moisture level that would be attained by wood that is in moisture
equilibrium with the material being tested. The full measurement range is from 6 to 90 but values over
Readings at depths from surface readings up to 25 mm (Using a hammer probe) can be taken.
Cavity and confined space Moisture readings using a Rotronic, high precision temperature and humidity
probe, together with a fully specified HygroPalm23-A calibrator handheld with full logging functions
Destructive testing:
Actual moisture content: Where a very accurate moisture content is required this is done using an
Ashworth Mears “Speedy” moisture tester that gives actual moisture content by a % of weight of a
sample that is removed from the structure and tested.

0264_TA7.pdf,"The moisture survey of the house indicated in general the wall structures displayed dry readings. This
was particularly the case on the first floor, though there are some areas indicating higher readings on
the ground floor.
The area around the front door gave indication of high readings with the tenants confirming that in
adverse weather moisture penetrates this area. Examination of the external plinth above the front door
indicates that lead flashing has been removed, thus exposing the plinth at its interface with the wall to
the weather, which is then likely to penetrate the wall (Section 6.2). This is the probable source for high
readings at locations V and W. Further, the brickwork and mortar in this part of the building is cracked
and in a poor state of repair in places (Section 6.3).
The residents expressed concern about an area of continued moisture evidence in the northwest corner
of the living room. It was stated the outside wall has been exposed to flooding in adverse weather and
the tenants have undertaken remedial action to alleviate this. Measurements here indicated elevated
levels of moisture to the walls, though this does not appear to extend to the concrete floor in this area.
It is the opinion of the authors that the combination of remedial action, the installation of a positive
warm air injection system and maintained temperatures in the living room, is now contributing to the
drying process, though furniture placed up to or against the walls will slow progress.
An area of elevated moisture reading in the kitchen was surveyed close to the sink. Indicative readings
from the Tramex at this point did not confirm the possibility of moisture at depth and therefore it is the
opinion of the authors this is likely causal from living conditions.
In conducting the survey, several other factors were discovered which would contribute to the effects of
increased moisture load in the property;
 The bathroom forced fan that is operated on a pull chord by the tenant has an override switch
outside the bathroom, which can switch off the overrun. It is not extracting the air as effectively
as guidance would recommend and does not have sufficient overrun (Section 6.4).
 The property has UPVC window units throughout fitted with trickle vents. At the time of the
survey many of the trickle vents were closed, and are in need of a clean on the outside to
maintain their effectiveness (Sections 6.5 and 6.6).
 Thermal imaging revealed uniform cold spots in the south-east corner of the stairwell and along
the north-facing wall of the two bedrooms (Section 5). This suggests uneven distribution of loft
insulation raising the risk of cold spot condensation and consequent mould growth at times of
high air moisture content in the property.
 Several of the passive air vents are closed (Section 6.7).
 Chimney stacks require ventilation even when not in use and therefore should be unblocked and
have a vent installed (Section 6.8).
 Though difficult to avoid, furniture against cold walls causes a cold spot within a room
preventing warm internal air from maintain a constant state of dryness.",1
0034_LU1.pdf,"The tenant advises that for the past 10 years mould and damp has been a constant issue on the external
gable end wall within the hall, kitchen, extending up the stairs and into the bathroom.
A moisture survey recorded elevated readings both invasive and non-invasive in the reported areas
along with mould and decorative damage (see section 4.3). The paper along the external wall within the
hall and leading up to the top of the stairs was seen to be coming away with mould development noted
behind (See section 5.4). On the same wall leading into the bathroom further mould and decorative
damage was noted with mould also evident on the ceiling in this area (see section 5.6).
The kitchen to the rear of the property was seen to have mould development and decorative damage to
the external wall mainly around the back door and behind the cooker (See section 5.1 & 5.2).
Excessively high internal relative humidity levels were recorded in the affected areas along with a lack of
adequate heat and ventilation and, condensation was seen to be forming on the UPVC window within
the bathroom (section5.3).
The only extraction unit within the property was a cooker hood which was not in use at the time of the
survey and did not appear to vent to the exterior.
It was advised that three adults reside within the property with a baby due in the early part of 2018.
Seven to ten wash loads are processed per week with a condensing tumble dryer being used.
Brick built outhouses were observed to the side of the property one of which is a WC and the roof to this
separate structure is a cement based corrugated profile which butts up to the property. At the time of
the survey water droplets were noted to the underside of this sheeting constantly running down a
section of the exterior wall to the rear of the kitchen. This area is in direct correlation to survey location
point C (See section 5.3) where elevated moisture levels were recorded internally.
A number of cracks to the exterior of the WC and the upper levels of render were observed around the
property (See section 5.10). Cracking allows rainwater to migrate behind the render and this will then
tend to migrate to the inner surface due to the fact the render and exterior decoration greatly limits the
walls ability to vent the moisture to the exterior. If cavity wall insulation is installed, this can then be
affected by the moisture penetration leading to wetting of the inner leaf.
Based upon moisture readings at varying depths within the bathroom and taking into consideration the
number of cracks to the external rendered structure, it is possible moisture is indeed penetrating the
structure.",1
0143_E8.pdf,"12th May - Initial survey:
Significant levels of structural damp were noted through the property, this correlated with areas of
failure of wall decoration due to salts development. The main focus of the structural damp was the
Kitchen area; the nature of the loss would suggest an internal leak.
22nd May - Leak detection:
During the survey there were no leaks detected on the hot and cold water supply. The Policyholder
stated they have no issue with pressure loss on the combination boiler, ruling out a leak on the heating
pipe work. The policy holder has been advised to monitor boiler pressure. The bath taps are inaccessible
as they are tiled in. The ground mic was used on the shower mixer; no audible leak noise was noted
during the survey. The silicone seals around the bath were water tested and found to be leaking.
A leak was identified on the kitchen waste pipe behind the unit.",0
0246_BN18.pdf,"In 1965 it became a matter of regulation that ground supported concrete floor slabs should have a DPM (Damp
Proof Membrane) in their construction to prevent ground moisture from migrating to the surface of the slab. Prior to
this date it was the floor finish which acted as the DPM for example, thermoplastic tiles set on bitumen or wood
block flooring set on bitumen etc.
In bedroom 2, the main room of concern along with connecting areas, several moisture readings were recorded
which in the main gave dry readings.
The elevated moisture levels recorded correlate with previous plaster removal in the built-in wardrobe and at survey
location point 6. In addition, survey location point 7 around the chimney was also elevated. A sample of the wall at
survey point 6 has been taken for independent analysis as this can either suggest a salts issue or free moisture
issue because electronic moisture meters do not determine the difference.
Observations revealed minor mould at the base of the wall at survey location point 4 and staining to wall surfaces at
location points 6 and 7. Points 4 and 6 are highlighted in the thermal survey with condensation occurring at the
time.
It was noted internal humidity levels were raised in most rooms which will be driven by inadequate ventilation which
in part could explain the musty odours noted in bedroom 2.
This lack of ventilation is associated with no trickle vents which provide important background ventilation plus, the
mechanical extraction unit in the bathroom not working and the extraction unit in bedroom 3 underperforming.
In conclusion it is the author’s opinion the musty odours will be associated with a combination of dampness within
the wall plaster either from an external source or surface condensation and inadequate ventilation supported by the
recorded images and calculations made within the thermal imaging section. The gravimetric results (below) confirm
a free moisture ingress and further invasive checks are recommended in order to eliminate wetting of this localized
area. In addition, no trickle vents and issues with the mechanical extraction units as highlighted in the ventilation
section are also contributory factors for the internal atmospheric management.

Technical Structural Health Survey Report",1
0023_GU3.pdf,"Upon arrival the resident advised of concerns mainly to
areas of the lower walls and skirting in the bedrooms plus
the bay window and lower walls in the lounge area.
An assessment of the property was undertaken including a moisture profile through the main areas which
in general indicated a dry structure. However, localized elevated moisture readings were noted to areas
as indicated herein and could align to the structure as the skirtings emitted elevated readings with the
electronic moisture device alongside damp floors (section 4.0).
In the corners of the bedrooms and lounge mould was evident to the lower walls they also aligned to
areas where the elevated readings were recorded including the localized flooring. With gripper rods fitted
there remains a potential for their nailing to have disturbed the floor finish and is recommended this is
invasively checked for DPM effectivity and its condition (sections 6.1 & 6.2).
Of note, the resultant mould aligns with areas of minimal disturbance regarding air circulation and is
contributed to by contents being placed close to the affected areas with mould able to develop in the
areas of stagnant air.
The resident added the area to the rear of the property (as pictured above) is subject to periods of flooding
and pooling in areas and a visual review of the elevations displayed salts damage alongside the base of
the wall with no clear evidence of a DPC. With the property being circa 3 years old, there remains the
potential for the cavities to be insulated and, with air bricks installed this needs to be confirmed as they
can compromise the intention of the insulation measures.
With mould advised as having also affected contents items, the current ventilation measures installed to
control the atmospheric moisture were assessed and found to deliver flow rates below that
recommended in the relevant regulations. It is hereby suggested the installation information submitted
alongside the building completion is assessed for what flow rates were recorded at the time of installation
with any under-performing devices re-assessed and amended for compliance. This should include
confirmation of the extractor ducting points because they can lose energy over extended lengths of
ducting leading to a reduced performance because their locations are internal to the dwelling as a whole.
At the time of the survey, a visual review of the exterior to the side of the kitchen indicated an air brick at
possibly ceiling level however this being the extractor outlet was not confirmed.
The assessment should also include the door undercuts whereby a 10mm gap is recommended
particularly to kitchens and bathrooms to aid make-up air entering the room and upholding extractor
performance (sections 6.5 to 6.8).
In this property the bathroom is an internal room and therefore places a greater importance on ventilation
adequacy via the respective elements to control the internal atmospheric moisture load.
The room was being used at the time to dry washed clothing and, whilst this is a positive aspect on behalf
of the resident, in the absence of a window plus suitable performing extractor and door undercut, the
process will be less efficient and serve to take longer than expected possibly leading to the door being left
open resulting in atmospheric moisture travelling through the property due to vapour pressure
differences aiding mould developments in other areas.
To the exterior it may be a consideration to check the type and condition of any installed cavity wall
insulation and, how it relates to the lower-level air bricks that would serve to cool the lower cavity areas
that align with the internal lower wall and floor levels.
To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, a review of the building fabric is confirmed for the presence
of a DPC, DPM and CWI including the materials used alongside the open trickle vents. The extractor
installation documents should be reviewed for their installation flow capability alongside the levels
recently recorded.
To the exterior the downpipe requires a repair and the above recommendation should include this area
as the elevated moisture levels were noted in this adjoining interior.",1
0128_CT6.pdf,"The moisture survey undertaken (Section 4.0) indicated significant moisture levels affecting the wall
structures through the property and certainly was the case in areas where plastered brick wall
structures were present. Observed noticeable areas of damp would suggest similar moisture levels
extend behind the plasterboard dry lining to a number of areas of the property. It is the opinion of the
author the source or sources of moisture affecting the structure are ongoing rather than solely loss
moisture relating to the 2010 flooding event (Section 7.1). Further invasive investigations and testing
need to be carried out at the property to allow a clear understanding as to the causes of the issues
affecting the structure:
 Boxing to plumbed services through the property need to be opened as required and possible
further plumbing tests need to be carried out to confirm the integrity of the systems.
 Specification of reinstatement wall finishes should be obtained so that their compatibility with
the structure and previous damp remedial works can be assessed. Invasive investigations and off
site analysis may well be required to clearly understand the previously carried out damp
remedial works and the nature of the moisture of moisture affecting the wall structures.",0
0287_TQ2.pdf,"The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicates significant structural moisture levels throughout the
property with regard to both earth retaining walls and none earth retaining structures. The atmospheric
moisture levels recorded {Section 5.2} and the thermography survey undertaken (Section 6.0) indicated
condensation was not an issue in the property at the time of the survey. Significant moisture related
damage was noted through the property the nature of the damage would suggest structural related
moisture issues as opposed to atmospheric driven issue (Section 8.3). The level of damage noted would
indicate the issues noted have persisted over an extended period time.
With regard to the moisture related issues it was noted a number of the wall structures are dry-lined, it
is the authors opinion that structure related moisture issues also persist behind the dry lining. This is
likely to be a driver for interstitial mould activity in these areas, it is recommended these areas are
opened so that the structure can be clearly understood. Invasive drilled readings recorded in the solid
wall structure behind the dry lining to the first floor bedroom did indicate high structural moisture levels
(survey location 4).
With regard to water ingress, visible water ingress was noted to be affecting a number of areas to the
earth retaining walls through the first floor store room (Section 8.1). Based on the observations made
and moisture survey undertaken, it is the author’s opinion water ingress is affecting both earth retaining
and none earth retaining walls. Moisture evaporation from damp affected walls structures will add to
the atmospheric moisture load in the property.
With regard to water ingress through the roof structure and the question raised by the client regarding
the pitch. If this roof pitch is to shallow as reported weather driven water ingress is very likely and
observations would suggest this is an issue (Section 8.4). Redesigning the roof with a steeper pitch will in
the opinion of the author alleviate the issues noted with the current roof structure. When considering
the designed roof pitch the property location and in particular its exposure rating is critical. With regard
to wind and rain fall the property falls within exposure zone 4 (very severe), plus a review of google
earth would indicate the property is directly affected by prevailing weather. BS 5534:2014 Code of
practice for slating and tiling, with regard to a slated roof the standard recommends a minimum pitch of
20°. In addition to meeting current design recommendations it is the opinion of the author there should
be a certain amount of future proofing the new design, considering changing weather patterns it would
be prudent to consider a roof pitch steeper than the minimum recommended.
With regard to ventilation in the property; issues where recorded with regard to the forced ventilation
of the bathroom area (Section 7.2), whilst the bathroom has an opening window that is being used, it is
the opinion of the author that it would be prudent to install a better suited fan unit for venting damp air
from the bathroom. With regard to general ventilation in the property this is a low occupancy situation,
only one person lives at the property with occasional visits from an adult child. Observations and
readings recorded at the time of the survey would suggest the tenant is controlling the internal
atmospheric conditions reasonable well.
With regard to my client’s question regarding the existing windows and doors and the requirement to
replace these. It is the author’s opinion, these should not be replaced until all the damp problems and
roof problems are addressed new windows and doors are potentially airtight. Therefore, this could
substantially add to the problems as the existing draughty windows will help keep the moisture levels
lower inside the building.",1
0076_SE6.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey (Section 4.0) has been carried
out indicating in general a dry structure and, certainly this
was the case in regard to the window reveals and the
exterior walls being areas of concern.
In the bathroom significant structural moisture levels
were highlighted suggesting issues with waterproofing
around the bath such as the seal and waterproofing to
the walls (tiles) etc. Regarding use of the shower, It was
reported by the tenant recent repairs had been made to
the tiling. As indicated in the moisture survey elevated
readings were recorded from the floor extending into the
hallway and, can be driven by water draining down past
the bath seal plus possible water leaks. In addition it was
noted the shower curtain is short of just touching the top
of the bath encouraging the floor to be wetted while the
facilities are in use.
It was reported by the tenant leaks from the flat above
have also previously affected the bathroom and adjoining
area to the kitchen and, staining was noted to the ceiling
in the kitchen.
Significant ventilation issues were highlighted (Section 6.1) and in regard to the forced ventilation of the
bathroom an ineffective operation was indicated alongside the kitchen extraction which relies on
significant input from the tenant to operate correctly.
It is the opinion of the author, the source of moisture allowing the mould in the property to proliferate is
atmospheric. In general, this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of the
installed ventilation and, is certainly the case in the highlighted areas to the window reveals to the two
bedrooms. And, mould on contents items can only be sustained by atmospheric moisture conditions.",3
0165_ME14.pdf,"The thermal survey identified areas of cold to ceilings through the top and first floor areas. However
significant areas of cold were noted to the ceilings to bedrooms three and floor which corresponds with
the original concerns raised by the owners of the property. The noted areas of cold are located below
the eaves to the front elevation to the roof structure housing the top floor. A temperature drop of
approximately 5.0°C was noted in the highlighted areas.",1
0228_SS1.pdf,"The property was attended with Bakers of Danbury as instructed with the intention of surveying a
number of dwellings. However, access was only possible to two of the flats:
Flat 12: Water ingress has been previously addressed and minor cracking to plaster finishes to the door
reveal was noted with minor decoration required.
Flat 11: Mould activity and raised moisture levels were noted to the corner detail of the lounge window
units and observations would suggest a condensation issue. However, it may well be prudent to further
review the affected area from the exterior to confirm its integrity with regard to weather ingress.",0
0127_CR8.pdf,"Supplied information confirmed the conditions affecting the other flats which were also affected by the
loss have greatly improved over time.
Checks made with regard to the ventilation and plumbed systems in the property did not highlight any
issues which could cause raised humidity levels to persist.
With regard to insulation it is assumed the loss affected wall and floor structures are not insulated
(section 7.4). If insulation materials are present this should have been considered during the restorative
drying process. Damp insulation materials would cause ongoing damp issues to persist.
The moisture survey (Section 4.0) indicated raised moisture levels to the wall and floor structure areas
which were originally affected by the loss.
It was reported a ‘waterproofing sand and cement render’ has been applied to the walls. Renders in
general are gas permeable and as such will not prevent loss moisture in the form of water vapour
venting from the wall structures.
It is the opinion of the author the reported conditions being experienced in the property are being
driven by venting loss moisture which was not removed from the drying process.
Flat 1 is located on the North West facing elevation of the property and as such does not benefit from
significant levels of solar radiation warming the structure and this may well have an influence on the
ongoing passive drying of the structure. Mrs. Manning has indicated an improvement in the internal
conditions and is also the opinion of the author conditions will continue to improve through the summer
months.",0
0079_SO16.pdf,"The tenants moved into the flat approximately four years
ago and two years later had their first child.
It is understood that for quite some time, mould has been an issue especially in the colder months, with
concerns mainly relating to the wall surfaces in the bedroom. We are advised outbreaks of mould has
also affected a number of contents, some of which have had to be disposed of.
Wall surfaces are cleaned on a regular basis in order to remove the mould with the tenant advising the
previous clean was last week. In addition, the window in the lounge suffers from condensation and, due
to these conditions the tenant has expressed a concern for the health of their child.
A moisture survey was completed throughout the flat which revealed a dry structure and, regarding how
the flat is ventilated, there are mechanical extraction units in the bathroom and in the open-plan
kitchen/lounge area. At the time of the survey these units were in working order but require attention.
The windows have trickle vents fitted which appeared to be in good order however they were closed at
the time of the survey with it noted the windows were slightly ajar.
Observations did not reveal any current outbreaks of mould and could be due to the tenant having
recently cleaned the walls with staining noted in areas.
Additional observations revealed contents positioned in front of internal and external walls which with
the aid of thermal imagery confirmed cooler areas had developed behind them. Without adequate air
circulation, this can lead to condensation and mould becoming an issue that is not readily apparent.
In conclusion based upon a dry structure recorded and observations made, it is the opinion of the
author periods of elevated internal humidity levels and insufficient ventilation are the probable causes
highlighted by the tenant. This is supported by a dry structure and the non-use of background
ventilation plus the bathroom extraction unit and evidence of drying clothes in the property.",3
0091_TN18.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey has been carried out (Section 4.0) indicating in general a dry structure
through the first-floor areas and, includes the areas of concern highlighted by the occupant and detailed
on the floor plan. In regard to mould activity affecting the first-floor areas and possibly the occupants
contents, observations would indicate atmospheric moisture issues are the driver for the mould.
On the ground floors two areas were noted which would suggest structural damp issues:
 Corner of Dining room survey locations 24 – 25 (Section 6.2):
Significant damp was noted in this area with elevated readings also noted to the other side of
the wall in the rear entrance hall. Elevated readings were also noted to the skirtings.
 Lounge internal wall to Kitchen survey locations 32 – 33 (Section 6.2):
As with the highlighted area to the dining room, elevated readings were also noted to wall
structures and associated skirtings.
Regarding the plumbed systems in the property, it would be prudent to carry pressure testing etc. to
clearly understand if the property is being affected by any plumbing issues.
Elevated moisture issues were highlighted in many areas through the ground floor affecting the lower
wall structures however, in these areas, unlike those detailed above, dry readings were recorded from
the associated skirtings. The thermal survey (Section 5.0) indicated cold wall temperatures in particular
to the dining area (Section 5.4) and, is the opinion of the author condensation earlier in the day may
well be a factor in relation to the elevated readings noted. However, it would be prudent to carry out an
invasive survey of the lower wall cavity through these areas to confirm the integrity of the installed DPC
which is clearly evident from the exterior around the property.
As well as cold wall temperature, cool air temperatures were also recorded through the property and
will also have a significant influence on the internal atmospheric conditions.
It is the opinion of the author, the main source of moisture allowing mould in the property to proliferate
is atmospheric. In general, this is driven by occupational activity and issues with the effectiveness of the
installed ventilation whereby issues were highlighted to the bathroom unit (Section 6.1.3) which need to
be addressed to be compliant with part F of the building regulations.
It was also noted there is no extractor fan in the kitchen. A cooker hood was observed however, general
checks made would tend to suggest this unit is acting as a filter unit (Section 6.1.2) rather than an
extractor and as such it will not be assist in the control of humidity levels in the property.
Observations would also suggest there is an issue with meeting the ‘Whole dwelling ventilation rate’
provision as detailed in Part F of the Building regs. when intermittent fan units are installed.",3
0005_CM3.pdf,"A detailed moisture survey was carried out (Section 4.0) and highlighted in general a dry structure
however, a number of areas did display elevated readings:
The window reveals to the bedroom and lounge (Section 4.2.1).

The readings correlated with a previous survey carried out on 30th September 2020 however,
the recorded levels were considerably less.
With regard to elevated humidity levels and subsequent condensation issues affecting the property,
effective ventilation is required to control the atmospheric conditions. To this end continuous running
fans with boost functions have been installed however, there was some misunderstanding in regard to
their control on behalf of the tenant and was explained by the author at the time.
Based on the recorded flow rates, observations would suggest the installed fan units in the bathroom
and kitchen meet the requirements under part ‘F’ of the building regulations.
Regarding passive vents detailed in the storeroom and through into the bathroom (Section 6.1.4), in the
opinion of the author this set up is reducing the effectiveness of the bathroom fan to control the
humidity levels through the property.",3
0182_N8.pdf,"An invasive investigation was undertaken which clearly indicated the structural elements of the loss
affected bay window were saturated (Sections 4.1.1 & 6.1). A review of the balcony structure
highlighted a number of areas where weather ingress would occur (Section 6.3).
The thermal survey undertaken combined with the atmospheric moisture levels recorded showed
interstitial condensation was an issue with the ‘as built’ construction (Section 5.1). It was noted a vapour
control membrane had not been incorporated in the design and is the opinion of the author a vapour
control membrane should have been installed on the warm side of the insulation to prevent the internal
environment affecting the cooler areas of the structure.
It is the opinion of the author both weather ingress and interstitial condensation are affecting the loss
affected areas of the structure.",0
