       "['3.0 Conclusion: On arrival, the author was advised by a relative of the resident (who was at work) the concerns aligns to dampness being observed in areas of the property with stale odours also detected at times. On arrival the property appeared to be in general good order although some areas did display localised spoiling likely due to the overriding condition of the structure. A moisture profile was conducted through the property in order to assist determining a pattern through the dwelling as a whole and not just singular aspects (section 4.0). The readings were elevated in many areas both to internal and external walls. The floor also emitted elevated readings where was possible to the thermoplastic floor tiling and, can be considered a normal phenomena since the tiling will be acting as a DPM for ground moisture in the slab. However, a review of exposed floor areas indicated a number of gaps in the membrane and even some tiles removed resulting in a clear observation of the residual bitumen. This absence of a DPM will enable ground moisture to evaporate into the structure raising the potential for secondary issues. And, as it was notable in a number of areas, it remains highly likely why some areas of the installed timber floor also emitted elevated moisture readings. With this in mind, there remains a feasible problem with the membrane coverage as whole in the property resulting in the elevated readings obtained throughout. Also, in some areas the skirtings emitted elevated moisture levels and could likely be due to their contact with the ground or through the localised walls where they may be in contact with the concrete slab. To the exterior there was evidence of cavity wall insulation (CWI) with a number of drill holes noted and, what cannot be ruled out from the external wall perspective is the overall condition of the CWI in terms of its dampness as this can also act as a bridge for moisture to travel to the inner leaf and wet the internal walls. Whilst on site an assessment was undertaken of the installed ventilation measures with forced extractors installed in the bathroom and kitchen as this can also impact the internal conditions particularly in the colder periods of the year. Of note, trickle vents were installed in these rooms also and, they can also compromise the extractor performance by being able to draw air in from the exterior rather than from the rooms. A test of the bathroom extractor suggested it’s flow rate is compatible with the Part F of the Building Regs when on boost and a secondary boost function which is manually selected. However, for its optimum performance delivery it is recommended guidance is given to the tenant to keep the nearby window closed when this is operating for it to withdraw moist air from the property and not draw air in and straight out from the exterior. In addition, Part F of the Building Regs suggest a 10mm door undercut to enable ‘make- up’ air to be drawn into the bathroom from the dwelling and expel all moist air to the exterior. This door did not comply with the recommendations and hence, after the room is used, the difference in vapour pressure will result in the warm moist atmosphere circulating the property. In the kitchen the wall mounted device was switched off at the isolator and the tested flow rate was not compliant with the applicable regs. Also, with a variable door undercut, using the kitchen will also likely encourage atmospheric moisture to circulate the dwelling raising the potential for secondary issues. To conclude, it is the opinion of the author, there are indeed elevated moisture readings to the majority of the external and internal lower walls and, with notable gaps in the thermoplastic membrane acting as a DPM for ground moisture, the ongoing presence of ground moisture is a likely contributor to the reported damp related issues. This was endorsed by expected high readings taken on the exposed floor confirming its construction hence, it is recommended the floor covering as a whole is checked alongside the removal of all skirtings to assess the presence of a membrane to the lower wall from the floor. The introduction of a liquid DPM cannot be ruled out as a possible option to reduce this issue. In addition, the presence and condition of the CWI should be checked to ensure this is not a contributory factor also to the external walls because the addition of open air bricks can affect their condition.',\n",

As per the given text, these readings should indicate that the material checked could be said to be dry back to a satisfactory level of 15% or below.\\n\\nConclusion: Based on the survey equipment described in the text, it is clear that the materials being inspected for moisture and humidity are non-wood materials such as concrete or masonry. This makes sense since these materials do not have a natural ability to absorb water and maintain a dry environment, similar to wood. The readings taken from the Tramex MRH (Masonry scale) and Invasiive Mold/Moisture Meter indicate that the material checked could be said to be dry back to an acceptable level of 15% or less.'"
