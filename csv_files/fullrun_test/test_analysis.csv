"The reported damp and musty odours in the dental treatment room are primarily attributed to previous water escape incidents that may have led to residual moisture within the structure, particularly under the timber flooring. Additionally, the lack of adequate ventilation, especially when the room is closed for extended periods, can contribute to stagnant air and increased humidity levels, creating an environment conducive to mould growth despite current relative humidity readings being below the threshold for mould proliferation.",0992_W1B.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues in the property are primarily caused by inadequate damp proofing measures, particularly the absence of a proper thermoplastic damp proof membrane in certain areas, which allows ground moisture to penetrate the walls and floors. Additionally, poor ventilation in the kitchen and potential issues with cavity wall insulation (CWI) may be contributing to elevated moisture levels, leading to condensation and subsequent mould growth.",0001_BN17.pdf
"The reported mould issues in the property are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, particularly in the kitchen which lacks an extractor fan, and the presence of retrofit cavity wall insulation that may contribute to moisture retention. Additionally, the high relative humidity levels observed in various rooms, especially during winter months, create an environment conducive to mould growth.
