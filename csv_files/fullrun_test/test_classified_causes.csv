Additionally, the presence of cold strips at the ceiling edge in bedroom 1 and potential condensation in the loft area, possibly exacerbated by compromised ventilation, contribute to moisture accumulation. Overall, atmospheric moisture from occupational activities further supports mould proliferation.",0006_CM9.pdf
"The reported damp issue near the toilet may be attributed to localized water ingress or inadequate drainage, as the overall structure is dry and atmospheric moisture levels are not conducive to mould growth. This suggests that the dampness is not due to widespread humidity or condensation but rather a specific issue in that area.",0992_W1B.pdf
"The reported damp and mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate damp proof membrane (DPM) coverage, allowing ground moisture to evaporate into the structure. Additionally, the condition of the cavity wall insulation (CWI) may contribute to moisture transfer to internal walls. Poor ventilation practices, including non-compliant extractor fan performance and ineffective door undercuts, exacerbate the situation by failing to adequately remove moist air from the property, leading to elevated moisture levels throughout.",0001_BN17.pdf
"The reported mould issues are primarily caused by elevated and persistent atmospheric moisture levels, which are influenced by occupational activities and previous ventilation problems in the bathroom. Additionally, the absence of an extractor fan in the kitchen and the removal of the kitchen door exacerbate the situation by allowing damp air to circulate throughout the property.",1000_WD7.pdf
"The main causes of the reported damp and mould issues stem from inadequate ventilation and poor air circulation, particularly in the bathroom and adjoining areas. The malfunctioning extractor unit, lack of door undercuts, and inefficient ducting contribute to the inability to effectively expel moist air, leading to condensation and mould growth. Additionally, potential gaps in insulation and cold surfaces exacerbate temperature differentials, further promoting condensation in these areas.",0004_BS35.pdf
"The reported mould issues are primarily caused by inadequate ventilation, particularly due to a non-functional mechanical extraction unit in the kitchen and the use of the WC for storage, which limits airflow.
